70% of banking executives indicate that embedded finance is either core or complementary to their business strategy, yet only 20% currently offer embedded finance solutions

Ecosystem privacy and security challenges cited as top two barriers to innovation

ARMONK, N.Y. and FRANKFURT, Germany, Sept. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The IBM (NYSE: IBM) Institute for Business Value (IBV), in collaboration with the Banking Industry Architecture Network (BIAN) and Red Hat, today released findings from a new global study that reveals significant gaps between the stated priorities of surveyed banking executives and the customers they serve. The research examines how customers engage with the digital world and how banks invest in embedded finance to become part of the financial journey consumers experience on their platforms of choice.

Embedded Finance: Creating the Everywhere, Everyday Bank details findings from the responses of over 1,000 banking industry leaders and more than 12,000 consumers across five continents.

Embedded finance is the integration of financial products and solutions within the customer journey of non-financial services organizations in ways that help eliminate friction, and consequently, enrich the customer experience. Over 70% of the industry executives surveyed indicate that embedded finance is either core or complementary to their business strategies. Yet only 20% said they currently offer embedded finance solutions.

""Banks are facing a double whammy of challenges with pressure coming from non-traditional competitors such as the big techfins that have set new standards for customer expectations and are eager to deepen those relationships and from regulators pushing for open banking standards to level the playing field and drive more competition,"" said Shanker Ramamurthy, Global Managing Partner Banking & Financial Markets, IBM Consulting. ""Establishing a modern hybrid cloud architecture that enables easy access to data across the enterprise, the ability to leverage the potential of emerging technologies such as generative AI, and participation in a robust ecosystem of partners is paramount to a successful banking strategy in today's industry.""

While 80% of all consumers surveyed currently prefer to deposit their salary and keep their savings in traditional banks, 16% of respondents globally are already comfortable embracing the full digital experience with branchless institutions. Many consumers are seeking a higher level of engagement from their financial institutions with 79% of younger respondents being open to receiving insights on their better ways to save and 75% being open to guidance on investing.

Both banking leaders and consumers cited security as their most important priorities but banking leaders overestimated the importance of peer-to-peer payments and buy now pay later (BNPL) compared to priorities cited by consumers who designated good customer experience as their second highest preference, followed by mobile wallet functionality and rewards respectively.

Based on the study, gaps in technology infrastructure modernization, lack of application programming interface (API) standards and the portion of resources devoted to privacy and security are slowing progress toward realizing the business opportunities associated with embedded finance platforms and stand to impede the potential of exponential technologies, such as generative AI.

""It has never been more critical for banks to focus on how financial institutions can increase their competitive edge and improve the experience they provide their customers. The findings from the research show just how much work banks have to do before they can achieve this,"" said Hans Tesselaar, Executive Director, BIAN. ""We know from the work we're doing with our members, however, that before they implement real changes to their service offerings, they must first overcome the obstacles caused by a lack of technical standards and adopt a coreless banking approach to transformation. This will help the industry benefit from each and every technological development to create the bank of the future.""

SoftBank seeking to invest or partner with OpenAI: Report,"{'href': 'https://www.livemint.com', 'title': 'Mint'}","Sun, 17 Sep 2023 05:42:56 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy9zb2Z0YmFuay1zZWVraW5nLXRvLWludmVzdC1vci1wYXJ0bmVyLXdpdGgtb3BlbmFpLXJlcG9ydC0xMTY5NDkyMDA3NDM1My5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9uZXdzL3NvZnRiYW5rLXNlZWtpbmctdG8taW52ZXN0LW9yLXBhcnRuZXItd2l0aC1vcGVuYWktcmVwb3J0L2FtcC0xMTY5NDkyMDA3NDM1My5odG1s?oc=5,"After the blockbuster listing of its Arm unit, SoftBank is mulling over to make investment in artificial intelligence (AI). The global investment bank is also looking for a potential investment in OpenAI , the Financial Times reported on Saturday.

SoftBank is seeking to invest in artificial intelligence companies and may seek to spend tens of billions in the sector, reported FT citing people familiar with the matter.

The company also made a preliminary approach to buy Graphcore, a UK-based AI chipmaker. However, Graphcore denied it had received an offer from SoftBank. The bank has declined to respond the queries of FT.

SoftBank partnership with OpenAI and ChatGPT

The Japanese tech investment firm is also planning to strike a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, FT said.

In June, SoftBank founder, Masayoshi Son, saidthat his tech investing conglomerate is planning to shift its stance to ""offence mode"" amid excitement over advances in AI.

Son has expressed excitement about AI technology, adding he is a ""heavy user"" of ChatGPT, the AI-powered chatbot from Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI. He has also said that he speaks ""almost everyday"" to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

The firm is also looking at a range of alternatives to OpenAI, including Graphcore, and other companies. SoftBank secured a $54.5 billion valuation in its US initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday, seven years after SoftBank took the company private for $32 billion.

In August this year, SoftBank posted a surprise loss but said it was dipping its toes back into new investments after its Vision Fund returned to the black for the first time in six quarters.

The Japenese firm has been in “defence mode"" since May 2022 after tech valuations crashed due to sharply higher interest rates and jitters that hit the global banking sector."
"IRS announces sweeping effort to restore fairness to tax system with Inflation Reduction Act funding; new compliance efforts focused on increasing scrutiny on high-income, partnerships, corporations a","{'href': 'https://www.irs.gov', 'title': 'IRS'}","Fri, 08 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcnMuZ292L25ld3Nyb29tL2lycy1hbm5vdW5jZXMtc3dlZXBpbmctZWZmb3J0LXRvLXJlc3RvcmUtZmFpcm5lc3MtdG8tdGF4LXN5c3RlbS13aXRoLWluZmxhdGlvbi1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tYWN0LWZ1bmRpbmctbmV3LWNvbXBsaWFuY2UtZWZmb3J0c9IBAA?oc=5,"Agency focus will shift attention to wealthy from working-class taxpayers; key changes coming to reduce burden on average taxpayers while using Artificial Intelligence and improved technology to identify sophisticated schemes to avoid taxes

IR-2023-166, Sept. 8, 2023

WASHINGTON — Capitalizing on Inflation Reduction Act funding and following a top-to-bottom review of enforcement efforts, the Internal Revenue Service announced today the start of a sweeping, historic effort to restore fairness in tax compliance by shifting more attention onto high-income earners, partnerships, large corporations and promoters abusing the nation's tax laws.

The effort, building off work following last August's IRA funding, will center on adding more attention on wealthy, partnerships and other high earners that have seen sharp drops in audit rates for these taxpayer segments during the past decade. The changes will be driven with the help of improved technology as well as Artificial Intelligence that will help IRS compliance teams better detect tax cheating, identify emerging compliance threats and improve case selection tools to avoid burdening taxpayers with needless ""no-change"" audits.

As part of the effort, the IRS will also ensure audit rates do not increase for those earning less than $400,000 a year as well as adding new fairness safeguards for those claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit. The EITC was designed to help workers with modest incomes. Audit rates of those receiving the EITC remain at high levels in recent years while rates dropped precipitously for those with higher income, partnerships and others with more complex tax situations. The IRS will also be working to ensure unscrupulous tax preparers do not exploit people claiming these important tax credits.

""This new compliance push makes good on the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure the IRS holds our wealthiest filers accountable to pay the full amount of what they owe,"" said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. ""The years of underfunding that predated the Inflation Reduction Act led to the lowest audit rate of wealthy filers in our history. I am committed to reversing this trend, making sure that new funding will mean more effective compliance efforts on the wealthy, while middle- and low-income filers will continue to see no change in historically low pre-IRA audit rates for years to come.""

""The nation relies on the IRS to collect funding for every critical government mission -- from keeping our skies safe, our food safe and our homeland safe. It's critical that the agency addresses fundamental gaps in tax compliance that have grown during the last decade,"" Werfel added. ""There is a sea change taking place at the IRS in every aspect of our operations. Anchored by a deep respect for taxpayer rights, the IRS is deploying new resources towards cutting-edge technology to improve our visibility on where the wealthy shield their income and focus staff attention on the areas of greatest abuse. We will increase our compliance efforts on those posing the greatest risk to our nation's tax system, whether it's the wealthy looking to dodge paying their fair share or promoters aggressively peddling abusive schemes. These steps are critical for the future of the nation's tax system.""

For the broader compliance work going on across the IRS, this will be an expansive effort with more details to be announced in the weeks and months ahead. Key elements of this new effort include:

Major expansion in high-income/high wealth and partnership compliance work

Prioritization of high-income cases. In the High Wealth, High Balance Due Taxpayer Field Initiative, the IRS will intensify work on taxpayers with total positive income above $1 million that have more than $250,000 in recognized tax debt. Building off earlier successes that collected $38 million from more than 175 high-income earners, the IRS will have dozens of Revenue Officers focusing on these high-end collection cases in FY 2024. The IRS is working to expand this effort, contacting about 1,600 taxpayers in this category that owe hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.

Expansion of pilot focused on largest partnerships leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI). The complex structures and tax issues present in large partnerships require a focused approach to best identify the highest risk issues and apply resources accordingly. In 2021, the IRS launched the first stage of its Large Partnership Compliance (LPC) program with examinations of some of the largest and most complex partnership returns in the filing population. The IRS is now expanding the LPC program to additional large partnerships. With the help of AI, the selection of these returns is the result of groundbreaking collaboration among experts in data science and tax enforcement, who have been working side-by-side to apply cutting-edge machine learning technology to identify potential compliance risk in the areas of partnership tax, general income tax and accounting, and international tax in a taxpayer segment that historically has been subject to limited examination coverage. By the end of the month, the IRS will open examinations of 75 of the largest partnerships in the U.S. that represent a cross section of industries including hedge funds, real estate investment partnerships, publicly traded partnerships, large law firms and other industries. On average, these partnerships each have more than $10 billion in assets.

Greater focus on partnership issues through compliance letters. The IRS has identified ongoing discrepancies on balance sheets involving partnerships with over $10 million in assets, which is an indicator of potential non-compliance. Taxpayers filing partnership returns are showing discrepancies in the millions of dollars between end-of-year balances compared to the beginning balances the following year. The number of such discrepancies has been increasing over the years. Many of these taxpayers are not attaching required statements explaining the difference. This effort will focus on high-risk large partnerships to quickly address the balance sheet discrepancy. Prior to the IRA, the IRS did not have the resources needed to follow up and engage with all the large partnerships with such discrepancies. However, the IRS will soon have the resources and plan in place to ramp up this effort. It will begin in early October when the IRS will start mailing around 500 partnerships. Depending on the response, the IRS will add these to the audit stream for additional work.

Priority areas for targeted compliance work in FY 2024

The IRS has launched numerous compliance efforts to address serious issues being seen. Some of these, like abusive micro-captive insurance arrangements and syndicated conservation easement abuses, have received extensive public attention. But much more work continues behind the scenes on other issues.

Among some of the additional priority areas the IRS will be focused on that will touch the wealthy evaders include:

Expanded work on digital assets. The IRS continues to expand efforts involving digital assets, including work through the John Doe summons effort and last month's release of proposed regulations of broker reporting. The IRS Virtual Currency Compliance Campaign will continue in the months ahead after an initial review showed the potential for a 75% non-compliance rate among taxpayers identified through record production from digital currency exchanges. The IRS projects more digital asset cases will be developed for further compliance work early in Fiscal Year 2024.

More scrutiny on FBAR violations. High-income taxpayers from all segments continue to utilize Foreign Bank accounts to avoid disclosure and related taxes. A U.S. person with a financial interest over a foreign financial account is required to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) if the aggregate value of all foreign financial accounts is more than $10,000 at any time. IRS analysis of multi-year filing patterns has identified hundreds of possible FBAR non-filers with account balances that average over $1.4 million. The IRS plans to audit the most egregious potential non-filer FBAR cases in Fiscal Year 2024.

Labor brokers. The IRS has seen instances where construction contractors are making Form 1099-MISC/1099-NEC payments to an apparent subcontractor, but the subcontractor is a ""shell"" company that has no legitimate business relationship with the contractor. Monies paid to shell companies are exchanged at Money Service Businesses or flowed through accounts in the name of the shell company and returned to the original contractor. The IRS will be expanding attention in this area with both civil audits and criminal investigations. The scheme has already been seen in Texas and Florida. Work in this area is critical to improve compliance, and it will also help level the playing field for contractors playing by the rules as well as ensuring proper employment tax withholding for vulnerable workers.

Helping working taxpayers through improving compliance selections; protecting taxpayers and businesses from aggressive scams and schemes

In addition to expanding compliance attention on high-income, partnerships and others, the IRS will be focused on ensuring audit fairness and protecting all taxpayers from a variety of scams and schemes. While IRS compliance work will be increasing on the wealthy, scammers and fraudsters frequently target average taxpayers with more modest incomes, so the IRS will be focused on raising consumer awareness on these issues.

""The IRS is on the side of taxpayers, and we will be working to protect hard-working people from scammers or fraudsters who try to use the tax system for their schemes, whether it's promising people inflated EITC amounts or tricking people into tax-related identity theft,"" Werfel said. ""Protecting hard-working taxpayers is a critical component to ensuring the success of the nation's tax system, and the IRS will be working throughout the fall and into the 2024 filing season to take steps to help people.""

Improved equity in audits. The IRS continues to focus on making improvements in audits involving Earned Income Tax Credits and will be implementing changes for the next filing season. More details will be available on this later in the fall.

Emerging scam issues. The IRS will continue its aggressive work warning consumers about emerging scams and schemes. Building off efforts like the Dirty Dozen, the IRS plans to warn taxpayers about quickly emerging scams. As the IRS has seen through the years, scammers frequently adjust or change their tactics to tag onto recent tax law changes or other events that can confuse taxpayers into trying to claim refunds worth thousands of dollars. This effort can touch on issues like sick leave and family leave as well as false fuel tax credit claims.

Protection against identity theft. The IRS will continue the ground-breaking efforts of the Security Summit initiative, a joint effort between the federal government, state tax agencies and the nation's software and tax professional communities. Since 2015, the private-public sector coalition has worked together to build internal defenses and share information to protect against identity thieves trying to steal tax refunds. A key part of the Security Summit initiative has been focused on raising taxpayer and tax professional awareness on how to protect themselves and their tax data from identity theft. This ground-breaking effort will continue this fall with National Tax Security Awareness Week."
Guest view: Bank balance sheets hide climate risks,"{'href': 'https://www.reuters.com', 'title': 'Reuters'}","Fri, 15 Sep 2023 12:57:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2JyZWFraW5ndmlld3MvZ3Vlc3Qtdmlldy1iYW5rLWJhbGFuY2Utc2hlZXRzLWhpZGUtY2xpbWF0ZS1yaXNrcy0yMDIzLTA5LTE1L9IBAA?oc=5,"LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The thing about financial crises is that they surprise you. While regulators rightly fret about interest rate risk hidden in banks’ balance sheets, the threat from global warming continues to build in the shadows. Unless lenders reset their financial statements for the reality of accelerating climate change, and watchdogs adjust their models, investors and the planet will end up worse off.

There are two reasons to be worried. First, banks’ financial statements appear to be ignoring climate risks, which means financial institutions are probably also leaving those dangers out of their capital calculations. Second, a regulatory regime that understates the expected consequences of climate change is allowing the banks’ blind spot to persist.

A good place to start in scrutinising whether financial statements properly reflect the risks of higher temperatures is the assumptions banks make about expected credit losses (ECLs), also known as bad debt charges. Not only are ECL assumptions important to banks’ financial strength – higher charges reduce profits and shrink capital – but they are also subjective. To determine ECLs, banks combine forecasts about growth as well as industry and location-specific factors that could influence future default rates.

Climate change will likely impact both. Chronic and acute changes to weather patterns, including drought, flooding, hurricanes, heat stress or deep freezes, will harm economic activity and human wellbeing. Meanwhile, tighter government restrictions on carbon emissions and accelerating technological innovation will upend industries that run on fossil fuels. Without mitigating action, these developments will push up the risk of defaults, whether on mortgages in exposed coastal regions or project finance loans to oil and gas producers.

However, when we look at banks’ ECL assumptions there is normally silence on climate risks. Wells Fargo’s (WFC.N) latest financial statements, for example, use three scenarios to underpin ECL assumptions. None of these scenarios explicitly considers climate change. They forecast for two years and then assume a return to historical norms. But what happens if global warming or the revolution in renewable energy precludes a return to historical norms?

The few banks that refer to climate risks in their accounts tend to conclude that it is not material. HSBC (HSBA.L), (0005.HK), for instance, states: “Management has considered the impacts of climate-related risks on HSBC’s financial position ... (and) do not consider there to be a material impact on our critical judgements and estimates ...”. This raises the question of when rising risks would become significant.

To be clear, this is not about banks stopping all financing of activities that involve climate risk. Rather, it’s about ensuring these risks are properly costed and reflected in decision-making. To understand banks’ reluctance to show the effects of climate change in their accounts, it is instructive to consider climate stress-testing by prudential regulators.

The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which brings together 127 central banks working on climate change, models a cumulative 8% hit to global GDP by 2050 in a scenario where temperatures rise 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100. This equates to a loss of 0.1% of global output per year; almost a rounding error. Moreover, the models assume the impacts only really show up after 2030.

Using NGFS models, the European Central Bank’s 2022 Climate Stress Test found that, under a warming scenario of 3 degrees or more, banks projected that loan losses in the decade to 2030 would rise by a vanishingly small 0.005%. Lenders projected a similar low impact under a scenario of disorderly net zero transition. Even though climate-related losses rise over the years, they never go above 0.2% of performing loans.

How to reconcile this relatively benign picture with scientists’ warnings of devastating economic hardship? According to recent analysis by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and the University of Exeter, models such as those compiled by NGFS are flawed because they assume away the most impactful climate harms. They omit tipping points that will likely result in self-reinforcing feedback loops, such as the abrupt thawing of the permafrost in boreal forests, and social responses like mass migration or war.

When it comes to the energy transition, banks’ models too often focus on a narrow set of variables, notably a rising carbon tax. Lenders assume industry shifts will follow a steady path, rather than a rapid acceleration. This improbably narrow and cautious interpretation of the clean technology revolution leaves banks unprepared for the transformation to come.

These flaws in economic modelling help explain climate complacency in the banking sector. They should also galvanise urgent action. First, the prudential regulatory regime needs to become more prudent. Banks should recalibrate their models to reflect scientific scenarios, while central banks should require lenders to hold more capital against financing that is exposed to potential climate risks. Waiting until those risks materialise will result in greater financial instability.

Second, banks need to take a prudent view of climate risks in their financial statements. Auditors must demonstrate that they have kicked the tyres on the key assumptions. These are the expectations of more than 25 institutional investors which contributed to the development of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change’s Net Zero Standard for Banks, released in June. Where appropriate, regulators should sanction banks and auditors that do not meet these expectations.

Global warming is not a hypothetical scenario, but the reality of our changing planet. While flawed models are a problem anywhere, they amplify the economic damage when they infiltrate banks’ decision-making. The sooner the banking sector internalises climate risks in its accounting, the better the chance of building a sustainable future.

JOINT LEADERS’ STATEMENT: ELEVATING UNITED STATES-VIETNAM RELATIONS TO A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP,"{'href': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov', 'title': 'The White House'}","Mon, 11 Sep 2023 04:32:32 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy8wOS8xMS9qb2ludC1sZWFkZXJzLXN0YXRlbWVudC1lbGV2YXRpbmctdW5pdGVkLXN0YXRlcy12aWV0bmFtLXJlbGF0aW9ucy10by1hLWNvbXByZWhlbnNpdmUtc3RyYXRlZ2ljLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwL9IBAA?oc=5,"On September 10, 2023, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong and President of the United States Joseph R. Biden Jr. (the “Leaders”) met and held talks in Hanoi, Vietnam. The two Leaders hailed a historic new phase of bilateral cooperation and friendship by elevating their nations’ relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for the purposes of peace, cooperation, and sustainable development. The United States supports a strong, independent, prosperous, and resilient Vietnam.



In the ten years since President Truong Tan Sang and President Barack Obama formed the Vietnam–U.S. Comprehensive Partnership, the two countries have made remarkable strides in increasing mutual understanding, building mutual trust, and strengthening cooperation across all areas of the Comprehensive Partnership. Under this new framework, the Leaders underscored the fundamental principles guiding Vietnam–U.S. relations, including respect for the United Nations Charter, international law, and respect for each other’s political system, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Vietnam and the United States will continue to deepen cooperation in the following areas to ensure the interests of the people of both countries and contribute to peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity in the region and in the world.



POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS



The two Leaders underscored the need to continue deepening political and diplomatic relations, and will promote regular exchanges of delegations and engagements at all levels to strengthen mutual understanding and build and enhance political trust. The Leaders supported improving the effectiveness of current dialogue mechanisms and intend to establish an annual dialogue between Vietnam’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Secretary of State. The Leaders pledged to further promote relations between the two countries’ political parties and legislative bodies, including by encouraging dialogue and discussion between these bodies on priorities and each country’s practical experiences. The two Leaders will direct their government agencies to cooperate and effectively implement the cooperation programs as determined by both countries. Both countries affirm to maintain favorable conditions to complete the construction of their diplomatic and consular facilities, and ensure both sides can efficiently staff those facilities in accordance with international conventions to which both countries are parties, bilateral agreements between Vietnam and the United States, and the respective laws of Vietnam and the United States.



ECONOMIC, TRADE, AND INVESTMENT COOPERATION



The two Leaders reaffirmed the importance of economic, trade, and investment cooperation and innovation-driven inclusive economic growth as the core foundations and sources of momentum in the bilateral relationship. Both sides pledged to create favorable conditions and facilitate the further opening of markets for each other’s goods and services, support trade and economic policy, and regulatory measures to achieve this aim; and to address issues such as market access barriers via the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement. The United States applauds Vietnam’s progress in significant market-based economic reforms, and affirms its enthusiasm and commitment for a broad, strengthened, supportive, and constructive engagement with Vietnam in its transition to a market economy, and subsequently to market economy country status, under U.S. law. The United States noted Vietnam officially requested the review of its market economy status on September 8, 2023. The United States will review Vietnam’s request as expeditiously as possible, in accordance with U.S. law. The United States appreciates Vietnam’s ongoing efforts to further modernize and enhance the transparency of its monetary policy and exchange rate management framework, to promote macroeconomic stability, and to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system.



The Leaders will continue strengthening a non-discriminatory, open, fair, inclusive, equitable, transparent and rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core. Both sides applauded the progress thus far and look forward to additional substantial progress in the near future under the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), which will deliver concrete benefits to the economies, workers, families, and businesses of the two countries and the region.



The Leaders acknowledged the importance of respect for internationally recognized labor rights based on the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Furthermore, the Leaders intend to accelerate cooperation on strengthening intellectual property rights and aviation, including through negotiations to amend the U.S.-Vietnam Air Transport Agreement under Open Skies principles.



The United States pledged further support for Vietnam in manufacturing, high quality digital and physical infrastructure development, just energy transition, sustainable and smart agriculture, and broader and sustained participation in regional and global supply chains, with a particular emphasis on Vietnam’s Mekong Delta region. To that end, the U.S. International Development Financial Corporation (DFC) intends to continue to finance private sector projects in Vietnam’s infrastructure, climate and energy efficiency, healthcare, and small business sectors, including climate-focused and women-owned enterprises.



SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION, AND DIGITAL COOPERATION



Vietnam and the United States decided to strengthen science, technology, and digital innovation cooperation, regarding this as a new breakthrough of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The United States affirmed its commitment to increasing support for Vietnam in the training and development of a high-tech workforce. Acknowledging Vietnam’s tremendous potential as a major player in the semiconductor industry, the two Leaders pledged to support the rapid development of Vietnam’s semiconductor ecosystem and to work together energetically to improve Vietnam’s position in the global semiconductor supply chain. Toward this end, the United States and Vietnam announced the launch of semiconductor workforce development initiatives – supported by initial seed funding of $2 million from the U.S. government, in conjunction with future Vietnamese government and private sector support.



Vietnam and the United States pledged to comprehensively cooperate in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship.



The two Leaders applauded the promotion of secure and reliable digital infrastructure in Vietnam, affirming its potential to provide new opportunities for digital capability enhancement to Vietnamese innovators to expand the growth of Vietnam’s digital economy. These efforts will aim to include support for open and interoperable network architectures including through exploring the launch of an Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN training lab) in Vietnam, secure 5G, and adoption of emerging technologies to prove new digital upskilling opportunities to Vietnamese innovators, subject to congressional notification.



The Leaders underscored the importance of continued collaboration between leading academic institutions in the United States and Vietnam, including through joint research initiatives, training courses, fellowships, and exchange programs focused on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.



EDUCATION AND TRAINING COOPERATION



The United States announced concrete plans to assist Vietnam in training a high-quality workforce, contributing to the achievement of Vietnam’s future development goals. The United States welcomes the nearly 30,000 Vietnamese students studying in the United States and will encourage American educational institutions to accept a greater number of Vietnamese students. The two Leaders offered congratulations on the launch of Peace Corps operations in Vietnam and the 31st anniversary of the Fulbright Vietnam program. They applauded the work of Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV) and its growing role as a regional hub for public policy training, recognizing the vital importance of investing in human capital as a critical resource for future prosperity, security, stability, and development.

"Co-op Bank kicks off sale with early October bid deadline, sources say","{'href': 'https://www.reuters.com', 'title': 'Reuters'}","Thu, 14 Sep 2023 12:11:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvY28tb3AtYmFuay1raWNrcy1vZmYtc2FsZS13aXRoLWVhcmx5LW9jdC1iaWQtZGVhZGxpbmUtc291cmNlcy0yMDIzLTA5LTE0L9IBAA?oc=5,"A sign is seen outside a branch of the Co-operative Bank in central London May 10, 2013. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The Co-operative Bank's owners have set an early October deadline for non-binding bids for the British midsize lender, kicking off the long-awaited sale, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Co-op Bank has shared information on its business with multiple prospective buyers, after rival banks and financial investors expressed interest in a deal over the summer, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

A representative for Co-op Bank declined to comment.

The sale is being closely watched as one of the first examples of long-touted consolidation among Britain's midsize lenders.

Smaller financial institutions have also come under closer scrutiny after a series of bank failures, even though rising interest rates have made lending more profitable.

Co-op Bank had a book value of 1.3 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) at the end of December. Listed UK banks trade on average at 60% of their book value, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and Reuters' calculations.

Despite interest from financial investors, Co-op Bank is more focused on a deal with a competitor, two people said. The company's valuation will depend on how a transaction is ultimately structured, one of them added.

Among those weighing bids are specialist lenders Shawbrook, Aldermore and Paragon Banking Group (PAGPA.L), in a move to secure access to cheaper current account deposits, two of the people said.

OSB Group (OSBO.L) may also be among those bidding, although a recent drop in its shares makes a transaction more uncertain, a fourth person familiar with the matter said.

Aldermore, OSB, Paragon and Shawbrook declined to comment.

Co-op Bank is controlled by several hedge funds who took the keys of the company in a restructuring process in 2017, as well as buyout houses Bain Capital and JC Flowers & Co.

Bain declined to comment. A spokesperson for JC Flowers did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Reuters reported in April that the bank and its shareholders were considering strategic options, including a sale or initial public offering (IPO), with the help of Fenchurch Advisory and PJT Partners.

Macquarie Asset Management becomes lead investor in Verkor Series C fundraise,"{'href': 'https://www.macquarie.com', 'title': 'Macquarie Group'}","Thu, 14 Sep 2023 07:37:49 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYWNxdWFyaWUuY29tL2F1L2VuL2Fib3V0L25ld3MvMjAyMy9tYWNxdWFyaWUtYXNzZXQtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1iZWNvbWVzLWxlYWQtaW52ZXN0b3ItaW4tdmVya29yLXNlcmllcy1jLWZ1bmRyYWlzZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5,"Macquarie Asset Management, on behalf of its Energy Transitions Solutions fund, has today announced it will be the lead investor in Verkor’s Series C fundraise.

The French battery manufacturer has secured more than €2 billion of financing following the signing of a minimum of €850 million Series C funding round, approval of the European Investment Bank for €600 million of debt support and French subsidies of approximately €650 million, subject to final approval by the European Commission.

The financing will accelerate the construction of Verkor’s first gigafactory in Dunkirk and the manufacture of high performance low-carbon battery cells. It will also support ongoing technological developments at the Verkor Innovation Centre for new manufacturing technologies alongside strategic investments across the battery value chain.

The funding round represents the largest ever equity raise for a French start-up. Macquarie Asset Management’s lead investment – structured by its specialist Green Investments team – is secured in partnership with Crédit Agricole Assurances, alongside other financial and industrial partners. The round size, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, is a minimum of €850 million and could increase in the following weeks.

Emmanuel Macron, President of the French Republic, commented: “Since 2017 we have been leading a proactive policy to launch an industrial reconquest everywhere in our territories. The results of this policy are conclusive: we have created new jobs and enhanced the attractiveness of our country. This new, historic fundraising for French Tech, with the support of France 2030 resources, is a bold sign of our ambition for reindustrialisation. It also demonstrates the full coherence of our innovation policy at national and European level, with the support of everyone, investors, large companies and local territories. You are exemplary, and I congratulate you!”

Chris Archer, Co-Head of EMEA for MAM Green Investments said: “Achieving the electrification of Europe’s car industry by 2035 will require significant investment in battery manufacturing supply chains. Macquarie Asset Management is well placed to play a leading role in mobilising the significant volumes of private capital required to enable this huge industrial transition. Verkor has assembled one of the leading teams, developed a robust technical solution and won the backing of state and leading industrial partners. The long-term commercial agreement with Renault Group secures the investment case for the first gigafactory and together with this fundraising signals Verkor's transformation from a startup to a leading player in the European battery space.""

"Financial Institutions See Technology More Than Ever as Key Differentiator in Customer Experience, Says ISG","{'href': 'https://www.businesswire.com', 'title': 'Business Wire'}","Fri, 15 Sep 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIzMDkxNTQxODc3MS9lbi9GaW5hbmNpYWwtSW5zdGl0dXRpb25zLVNlZS1UZWNobm9sb2d5LU1vcmUtVGhhbi1FdmVyLWFzLUtleS1EaWZmZXJlbnRpYXRvci1pbi1DdXN0b21lci1FeHBlcmllbmNlLVNheXMtSVNH0gEA?oc=5,"PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Banking and financial services firms are navigating macroeconomic disruption, competition and cyber risks by leveraging technology to deliver unique, secure, personalized user experiences, say experts with Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm.

ISG and other leading industry experts will explore how banking and financial services (BFS) institutions can harness data, automation and AI to differentiate their services; deliver seamless, personalized customer experiences; integrate change management and mitigate risk, at the ISG TechXchange: Banking and Financial Services event, September 19 and 20, at Les Jardins de Saint-Dominique in Paris. Featured speakers include executives with Standard Chartered Bank, Citi, Santander Germany, Crédit Mutuel, Conseil National Stratégique de l’Intelligence Artificielle, France FinTech, OCBF, Cognizant and Engine by Starling.

“High-performing firms in the BFS industry are seeing opportunities even in times of macroeconomic and market upheaval,” said Colas Truong, ISG partner and host of the event. “Agile use of technology enabled these institutions to navigate the pandemic and it is now enabling them to meet consumer demands for new digital assets, personalized services and security, while demonstrating their shared commitment to social values.”

As much as 10 percent of consumers say they would switch their business if their bank were not sufficiently ESG-focused, Truong said.

Banking customers and institutions are also focused on cyber risks. Customers are examining which financial institutions are behind crypto-related services and new digital assets to determine if they are a safe form of investment and trading. At the same time, nearly 80 percent of global banking and financial services executives who responded to the recent ISG Cybersecurity Buyer Behavior Study said emerging technologies like AI and machine learning are a top-three challenge.

Finding a balance between a frictionless customer and employee experience and robust security processes will be the topic of a panel discussion, “Strengthening Cybersecurity in Banking and Financial Services,” featuring Roger Albrecht, ISG partner and co-lead of ISG Cybersecurity; Frederic Malicki, chief technology officer for the SECEMEA region with Atos-Eviden, and Alexis d'Arvieu, director general, Office de Coordination Bancaire et Financière (OCBF).

In another session, Paul Sweeney, solution architect at Engine, the software-as-a-service platform that powers Starling Bank, and ISG Lead Partner for Banking and Financial Services Owen Wheatley, will discuss whether banking as a service and the metaverse are “saviors” of banking growth or just hype, and how younger customers will impact ethics, data privacy and data ownership for these emerging technology-enabled channels.

In “Three Ways to Make Your Bank Future-Ready,” Jerome Dumaine, capital markets industry program lead for Cognizant, will detail the ways platforms and next-generation technologies deliver faster innovation, more efficient operations and sustainable business models. Separately, Alexandra Bensamoun, professor of law at Paris-Saclay University and member of the Conseil Stratégique de l’Intelligence Artificielle, recently established by Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, will join ISG’s Truong in a conversation, “Developing Compliant AI Systems,” to discuss the social, technical and legal opportunities and challenges of adopting AI and the standards organizations should put in place.

Alain Clot, banking industry expert and president of France FinTech, a non-profit association with more than 800 members, will share his vision on artificial Intelligence in banking in an industry spotlight interview. Also, Alexandre Saada, group CFO, Crédit Mutuel Alliance Fédérale, will showcase the winning partnership between IT and the business, and recent advances and innovations the bank has implemented to optimize their back-office operations in a presentation, “Evolution or Revolution? The Future of Banking through the Eyes of a Consumer.”

Suzan Dixon, head of workplace for Europe and the Americas at Standard Chartered Bank; Rob Garlick, head of innovation, technology and the future of work at Citi, and Daniel Sechi, director of IT strategy at Santander Germany, will participate in the panel discussion, “Digital Tools to Foster Growth and Employee Experience,” to share the digital changes they have implemented to address the people side of change and foster improved employee experience, higher morale and increased productivity.

In the ISG Startup Challenge, four enterprises will compete against each other: Welcome Place, a community-driven neobank that offers innovative and inclusive financial solutions in Europe; Multiverse Computing, a leading quantum software company; Quandela, which develops full-stack optical quantum computers, and Bankr Club, a matching platform for bankers and entrepreneurs. They will pitch their innovative solutions to a panel of judges before the audience votes on which technology they would implement in their own organizations.

The ISG TechXchange: Banking and Financial Services is sponsored by Wipro, Accenture, Cognizant, Eviden, Tech Mahindra and Kyndryl. CIOInsights, CIOReview, Artificial Intelligence and Applications, France FinTech, Office de Coordination Bancaire et Financière (OCBF), Open Banking Excellence and the Technology Business Management (TBM) Council are media partners.

Remarks by Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions Graham Steele at the Electronic Transaction Association Fintech Policy Forum,"{'href': 'https://home.treasury.gov', 'title': 'Treasury'}","Fri, 15 Sep 2023 22:03:57 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZS50cmVhc3VyeS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9qeTE3MzfSAQA?oc=5,"Thank you for inviting me to be here. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department. It is a privilege to speak with you today.

As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, including developing the Department’s policy views on banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. As the title would suggest, financial institutions are at the heart of my portfolio, and payments is a key area of focus.

Payments have long been one of the core financial services provided by financial institutions, along with the provision of credit and deposit-taking. At the same time, payments is a dynamic and fast-evolving space. The landscape is shifting at an unprecedented rate, with new systems and technology, intermediaries—and even new forms of money—emerging all the time. These developments carry novel and significant implications for the financial system and for consumers and are confronting policymakers with renewed questions about the roles and objectives of the public and private sectors.

At a high level, the role of the public sector is to promote both competition that benefits consumers and the marketplace and responsible behavior and practices that protect consumers and the financial system, including through regulation. This balancing role remains a constant for government, though a dynamic, competitive market presents new questions and issues to consider on how best to strike that balance. One question that has come into focus in this Administration is whether competition in payments and certain areas of financial markets is driving advances that benefit consumers, after holistically considering the new risks they present.

Competition in Payments

For consumers, a competitive marketplace means more choices, better service, and lower prices. By contrast, lack of competition can result in sustained market power, and diminished innovation, product quality, and access. In our report on Assessing the Impact of New Entrant Non-bank Firms on Competition in Consumer Finance Markets released last year, we explored trends across consumer financial services markets and identified evidence both of increased competitive pressures from new entrants as well as increased complexity, presenting both opportunities for increased consumer benefit as well as risks.

New entrant non-bank firms are offering digital applications to make payments online and through mobile devices that have expanded accessibility for consumers. These payments firms generally provide a front-end digital user interface for consumers to make payments to other parties on the same platform. At the same time, due to their near-exclusive access to the Federal Reserve’s payment services and the ability to settle obligations in central bank funds, incumbent depository institutions play a critical role in retail payments and most payments in the U.S. rely on interbank payment services as part of their settlement processes. As highlighted in Treasury’s report on The Future of Money and Payments, broadening the range of institutions that are eligible to participate in instant payment systems—subject to appropriate conditions and guardrails—could help to enhance speed and efficiency, competition, and inclusion in payments, including for cross-border payments.

Open Banking is another innovation with the potential to promote greater competition in payments. In Europe, regulatory frameworks such as Revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2) have been at the forefront of policy development, setting standards to enable secure, consumer-permissioned data sharing, which can expand access and promote competition. The U.S. has been slower, due in part to policy uncertainties and competitive tensions among stakeholders in the consumer finance ecosystem. Promoting Open Banking could help new entrants into the payment space to offer new products and services that compete with the legacy products and services offered by incumbent firms.

By contrast, the entrance by Big Tech into financial services could also have different, but nonetheless profound, effects on the payments landscape. As we noted in our competition report, these firms’ potential to scale rapidly, due to network effects and strategic complementarities, could result in increased market concentration. The historical separation in the United States of banking and commerce was motivated by a desire to prevent conflicts of interest, avoid excessive concentration of economic power, and limit contagion between affiliates—where the failure of a commercial platform leads to impairment of the safety and soundness of the affiliated bank. Big Tech’s involvement in financial services presents many of these historical issues, in addition to novel banking and commerce concerns. Big Tech firms may have incentives to leverage their existing commercial relationships, consumer data, and other resources to enter new markets, expand their networks and offerings, and scale rapidly to achieve capabilities that other firms do not have and cannot replicate. They may be able to use data advantages, network effects, acquisitions, predatory pricing, and other tactics to gain or entrench their market power to the detriment of competition and, ultimately, consumers.

Finally, the public sector has a unique additional role in payments, through the Federal Reserve System’s role as a provider of core market infrastructure. The launch of the real-time gross settlement rail, FedNow, creates new possibilities for innovation and competition in the provision of instant payment services. The introduction of FedNow adds a second set of instant payment rails alongside the existing private sector Real-Time Payments network operated by The Clearing House.

There is room for incumbent and new entrant firms to innovate expand access and choice in products and services that meet consumers’ needs—particularly those that are persistently underserved or unserved. Increased competition and innovation can bring positive change to the provision of financial services, but risks must be monitored and addressed to ensure that consumers are protected and that payment solutions promote their financial well-being.

Regulation of Payments

To best promote healthy, responsible competition, policymakers must be clear minded about the objectives of regulation and be cognizant of opportunities and risks related to market innovations. Regulation is an important tool for ensuring that innovation is done responsibly. While Treasury has generally recommended establishing a federal framework for payments regulation, in order to protect users and the financial system and support responsible innovations in payments, there are some specific areas that warrant immediate attention.

One such area is consumer data. Data is at the heart of the digital financial services ecosystem. The rise of fintech firms and their reliance on consumer data has raised valid concerns over privacy and security risks. New technologies and permissioned data sharing can beneficially expand access to financial services, but it is critical that consumer privacy and control be protected. The CFPB’s ongoing work on a rulemaking implementing Section 1033 is of paramount importance for personal data rights and helping to resolve core issues that have inhibited consumers’ control over their data. This effort is important to provide additional clarity and security in the data sharing landscape and contribute to further progress in Open Banking.

Additionally, Treasury supports the CFPB’s recently announced efforts to consider regulatory proposals relating to data brokers and data boundaries, thereby enhancing transparency and holding covered entities accountable for their data practices. Treasury has previously recommended that the CFPB consider whether and how it may directly supervise data aggregators, who store vast and ever-growing amounts of consumer financial data, generally without the kind of supervision of their data practices applicable to regulated depository institutions. The banking agencies have also issued guidance regarding the oversight of bank partnerships with third parties, including fintech firms. These regulatory and supervisory actions can help promote healthy competition that ultimately benefits consumers.

Another area that has been in focus is consumer fees. Despite other innovations, credit cards and debit cards remain the most prevalent instruments for consumer payments. Across the Administration, agencies have sought to target hidden fees and charges, as appropriate, to shore up competition by promoting fair and transparent pricing across the U.S. economy. In the payments space, the CFPB is working to finalize a rule aimed at reining in excessive credit card late fees. Here again, regulation has a role to play to protect consumers and promote healthy, competitive markets that are free of hidden or excessive fees.

It is also imperative to address the issue of fraud, especially in the era of digital transactions. With the increased speed and accessibility of digital transactions has come increased complexity in fraud and scams, particularly those targeting vulnerable populations. Addressing risks requires consideration of technological and policy solutions. This could include consideration of tools like advanced cryptographic methods, multi-factor authentication, programmatic anomaly detection, as well as prudent operating and governance procedures with safeguards like transactional limits. Ultimately, the public and private sector must work collaboratively to combat fraud.

In these and similar cases, measures to address the risks relating to new services may be effective. But we must also be mindful that those measures may also come with associated costs that have negative implications for the usability and uptake of the service or product. It is important that industry participants and policymakers remain aware of the full range of tradeoffs involved when we design products and policies, respectively.

Emerging Issues in Payment Instruments

In addition to payment rails and services, we are also experiencing a nascent disruption in payment instruments. As we have seen, the provision of payment services can position providers well to provide transaction accounts that function in ways that may resemble demand deposit accounts, as well as credit products. At times, this may come without the full protections of the traditional banking system that consumers have come to rely on and expect from their service providers.

With respect to demand deposit-like transaction accounts, consumers may maintain balances that may be uninsured and may function as an implied cost of accessing services. For traditional deposit accounts, the ease with which depositors can initiate transfers of their funds, facilitated by new technologies and service providers, may also have changed the nature and speed of bank runs, presenting new types of financial stability risks that also require attention. Finally, some crypto-asset companies have marketed their products as safe and deposit-like when they are nothing of the sort. On this last point, the Treasury Department, along with the other members of the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, has recommended that Congress enact legislation to ensure that stablecoin issuers are subject to a robust federal prudential regulatory framework.

This evolution in the nature of payment instruments is an area where regulation clearly has a role to play in protecting consumers and facilitating responsible innovation and competition. As such emerging developments progress, managing the opportunities and challenges they present will require cross-sector engagement, and a focus on driving advances that benefit consumers.

Financial Inclusion Strategy and Outreach

Our objectives to promote healthy competition, consumer benefit, and inclusive payments systems are central to Treasury’s work on the national financial inclusion strategy, consistent with congressional direction. This strategy was touched upon in the panel held earlier today, moderated by the Director of Treasury’s Office of Consumer Policy, Natalia Li.

The objective of the strategy is to define clear goals for financial inclusion, set measurable benchmarks for tracking progress, and provide recommendations on how public policy, government programs, financial products and services, technology, and other tools can promote financial inclusion.

As discussed before, payments are a foundational activity in consumer finance and are pivotal to financial inclusion. As the audience in this room can attest, the role of payments transcends basic transactions; payment systems connect individuals to the broader economy, enabling everything from purchasing goods to accessing broader financial tools.

At the same time, we must also remain acutely aware of the potential disparities that could be created or reinforced if new products and services are designed or implemented without adequately accounting for the concerns and needs of the most vulnerable and marginalized. For example, some evidence suggests that lower-income consumers are more likely to make payments in cash than consumers with higher income, even during the pandemic. This, in turn, suggests that certain consumers may be less willing, or less able, to participate in newer forms of payments. A few particular aspects of digital payments will help to determine their ability to promote inclusion.

First, privacy concerns and lack of institutional trust are among the most cited reasons that some individuals avoid the banking system. In particular, some communities may be more privacy sensitive and have heightened concerns about private or public entities accessing their personal information. It is important that we explore the policies, technologies, and methods available to appropriately preserve privacy protections in digital payment systems, including Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). Such technologies could play a crucial role in maintaining transactional privacy while also ensuring transparency and traceability, thus reinforcing the trust of users in digital financial transactions.

Another important element to consider is the degree to which payments systems possess offline capabilities, which could enhance financial inclusion by better supporting transactions in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Over the past 30 years, we went from less than 1% of the world’s population using the internet in the 1990s to over 60% of the world being internet users today. Nonetheless, we know that a significant number of individuals in the U.S. still lack access to reliable internet, and individuals who face barriers to mainstream financial services are also more likely to lack access to certain technology services and infrastructure. It is important to consider the needs of these marginalized communities as our payment systems evolve.

As this brief discussion hopefully demonstrates, advancing inclusion in payments will be a big focus of our work within the broader financial inclusion strategy. To shape the strategy, we intend to reach out to a diverse range of stakeholders across the financial ecosystem to gather their insights.

Conclusion

In conclusion, stakeholders across the public and private sector have a shared goal and incentive to foster competitive and innovative markets. Such dynamic markets present new opportunities and challenges, and there is a role for all players in helping to realize potential benefits while mitigating risks.

At the same time, guardrails are vital to ensuring the proper functioning of markets and protecting consumers. After all, our payment system is built upon a foundation of mutual trust.

In the face of emerging developments, engagement across public and private sectors is key to understanding opportunities and challenges and identifying solutions that can promote healthy competition and consumer benefit, while ensuring financial inclusion.

Thank you again for having me today.

MEDIA ADVISORY: Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo to Travel to Nigeria,"{'href': 'https://home.treasury.gov', 'title': 'Treasury'}","Fri, 15 Sep 2023 21:05:37 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZS50cmVhc3VyeS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9qeTE3MzbSAQA?oc=5,"WASHINGTON – Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo will travel to Lagos, Nigeria September 17 – 19, 2023, as part of the Biden Administration’s commitment to deepening the U.S.-Africa economic and trade relationship. His visit aims to build on the already deep people-to-people ties between the United States and Nigeria, a strong and historic partner. In his engagements, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo, the highest-ranking Nigerian-American official in the Biden Administration, will highlight the economic and cultural ties between the two countries and will discuss how we can deepen our partnership to the benefit of both countries, by further developing business and investment in Nigeria with a particular focus on entrepreneurship, youth development, and women’s empowerment.

This trip follows Secretary Yellen’s travel to Senegal, Zambia, and South Africa in January, which was the first extended visit by a Treasury Secretary to sub-Saharan Africa since the Obama Administration. And it comes after President Biden and the Administration announced redoubled engagement with the continent during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last year.

As Africa’s largest population, democracy, and economy, Nigeria is an important and strategic partner on the continent. The Deputy Secretary will focus on how it is Nigeria’s people – its most valuable resource – who will shape and drive Nigeria’s economic prospects. Leveraging the vast Nigerian diaspora around the world, including in the United States where Nigerian-Americans have built successful businesses and prospered, can be a key part of that process.

On his trip, the Deputy Secretary will connect with entrepreneurs, creators, and others in the business community to gain their perspectives on how the United States can partner more effectively to realize the shared vision of a stronger Nigeria. He will discuss the opportunities available through programs like the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has provided eligible sub-Saharan African countries, including Nigeria, with duty-free access to the U.S. market for thousands of products. He will also share the many tools available through the U.S. government to promote investment in Nigeria, especially in the form of high-quality infrastructure that meets Nigerians’ needs, through initiatives like the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment (PGI). These include:

Power Africa, which has supported electricity generation projects for 3,000 MW of new capacity in Nigeria;

The U.S. Development Finance Corporation, which has a portfolio in Nigeria that includes everything from major power projects to microfinance to local health clinics;

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency, which has provided support for feasibility studies in Nigeria for sectors ranging from healthcare to internet access to clean energy;

Prosper Africa, which has facilitated 129 deals worth $1.4 billion, including sectors as diverse as beekeeping and healthcare technology; and

The PGI, which can provide values-driven and high standard infrastructure investment in countries like Nigeria.

Additionally, the United States has also been a leader in pushing for the evolution of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and their ability to act with sufficient speed and scale to address the world’s many challenges -- and, just as importantly, help catalyze private investment that addresses global development needs.

As Secretary Yellen said: “We believe that Africa will shape the future of the global economy. Africa’s demographic boom can create massive economic opportunity. And its talents and resources can grow global industries and drive global innovation. In other words, Africa’s success will mean success for all of us. And the United States is here as a partner to help Africa realize its massive economic potential at home and advance its growing leadership abroad.”

Trip Details

On Monday, September 18, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo will deliver major remarks on the U.S. – Nigeria economic relationship at the Lagos Business School. Media interested in receiving local event details should RSVP to LagosPressUSM@state.gov.

While in Lagos, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo will also host a banking and financial sector roundtable with key financial institutions to hear their views on the business and investment climate, as well as how the private sector is dealing with illicit finance risks.

He will meet with U.S. companies with a large presence in Nigeria to hear about the challenges faced by foreign firms, including those posed by corruption, and how to further build U.S. trade and investment ties.

He will tour the Vibranium Valley technology incubator in Lagos, where he will meet with entrepreneurs and startup founders, including those in the fintech and healthtech spaces.

The Deputy Secretary will also tour Ogidi Studios, a recording studio that works with top Nigerian musical artists and has partnered with major U.S. entertainment companies, including working on part of the soundtrack for the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.

Deputy Secretary Adeyemo will visit ReelFruit, a woman-owned agribusiness company that has received $2 million in USAID funding to construct a new factory and install new equipment, which will allow the company to meet growing domestic and international demand.

After visiting Lagos, the Deputy Secretary will travel to New York to meet with senior Nigerian government officials on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Further details about that stop will be available in the coming days.

"China sees ‘Cold War mentality’ in US-Vietnam pact, Vietnamese disagree","{'href': 'https://www.aljazeera.com', 'title': 'Al Jazeera English'}","Sat, 16 Sep 2023 02:40:53 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzkvMTYvY2hpbmEtc2Vlcy1jb2xkLXdhci1tZW50YWxpdHktaW4tdXMtdmlldG5hbS1wYWN0LXZpZXRuYW1lc2UtZGlzYWdyZWXSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvOS8xNi9jaGluYS1zZWVzLWNvbGQtd2FyLW1lbnRhbGl0eS1pbi11cy12aWV0bmFtLXBhY3QtdmlldG5hbWVzZS1kaXNhZ3JlZQ?oc=5,"Pulled in opposite directions by Washington and Beijing, everyday Vietnamese people say staying neutral is best.

Hanoi, Vietnam – When Vietnam’s Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and United States President Joe Biden upgraded diplomatic relations to their highest level last weekend, Chinese officials responded by raising the spectre of a new Cold War playing out in Southeast Asia.

China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning advised Washington to discard its “hegemonic and Cold War mentality” when asked about Trong and Biden signing up to a comprehensive strategic partnership equal to Beijing’s own relations with Vietnam.

Mao said that Washington should “abide by basic norms governing international relations” when dealing with Asian nations.

“We ask the US to respect regional countries’ shared aspiration for stability, cooperation and development,” she said, pointing out that Vietnam had “stressed on multiple occasions” that its relationship with Beijing was a “top priority in the country’s foreign affairs”.

US officials swiftly rejected claims that cosying up to Vietnam’s rulers – whom the US once fought a war against – was a chess board move in a new confrontation with China in the Indo-Pacific region.





Far from “any kind of Cold War move”, the partnership with Vietnam “epitomises what modern partnership looks like from the United States perspective”, Mira Rapp-Hooper, special assistant to the president and senior director for East Asia and Oceania at the National Security Council, told journalists on Wednesday.

Partnering with the US did not lock Vietnam into choosing between Washington or Beijing, Rapp-Hooper said.

“It’s not about [Vietnam] choosing the United States over anyone or anything; it’s about what we all stand for together,” she added.

US ambassador to Vietnam Marc E Knapper said the new relationship with Vietnam “isn’t about anyone else”. Though the references the ambassador gave for the value of the US-Vietnam partnership invoked hot-button topics involving China and its growing assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region.

“It’s about our two countries and the intrinsic value this relationship has in terms of our shared prosperity, our shared security, our shared interests in a free and open Indo-Pacific and a free and open South China Sea,” Knapper told reporters.





China claims almost all of the South China Sea and its growing assertiveness to ownership of the vast maritime area has led to confrontations between the Chinese coast guard and vessels from countries in Southeast Asia who also claim territory in the disputed waters, particularly the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

On the eve of Biden’s visit, Al Jazeera spoke to several Vietnamese people about their government’s growing warmth towards the US, and what it might mean for relations with China.

‘Vietnam can remain in a neutral position’

Biden left a faint impression as president compared with his predecessor Donald Trump, said My Linh, a 22-year-old law student based in Ho Chi Minh City and currently taking a gap year from her studies.

Nevertheless, Biden was the third US president in a row to visit Vietnam, after Trump and Barack Obama, and Vietnamese people were happy with the attention from Washington and the “US relationship is quite good”.

“Joe Biden’s arrival goes further to show that Vietnam can maintain good diplomatic relations with the US – regardless of who the incumbent president is, or which political party they come from,” Linh said.

That the US would sign up to such a partnership even though Vietnam remains “a socialist country” showed a certain shrewdness in Vietnam’s diplomacy, Linh told Al Jazeera, adding that she hoped increased economic and educational opportunities would flow from big US firms investing in the country.





While China might accuse the US of pulling Vietnam towards its sphere of influence, Linh said Vietnam was being pulled by both superpowers in their respective directions. Vietnam, however, would remain neutral.

“I think any world power would want to pull other countries close to them, especially the US and China, who both strive to achieve global hegemony,” she said.

“I have confidence and take pride in Vietnam’s diplomatic policies. We can be stern when it’s called for but still remain diplomatic. We don’t shy away from historical facts … Whether we welcome an American or Chinese delegation, Vietnam can remain in a neutral position.”

Critical of Biden for escalating the war in Ukraine, which Nguyen Hien described as a conflict really between NATO and Russia, the small rubber parts manufacturer from Hanoi said the majority of Vietnamese people want good relations with the US.

Closer ties with Washington means Vietnam has an opportunity to “advance our economic and social conditions”, Hien said. But he also warned that Vietnam must not lose “agency” in such a relationship and must not be drawn entirely to any particular side amid current geopolitical tensions.





“With the US, China and even Russia, Vietnam is standing in the middle of conflicting tides. The US wants to pull us towards them as Vietnam has an important position in the Southeast Asia region,” Hien said.

“Vietnam should not lean towards anyone extremely. But Russia and Vietnam have been fond of each other since the past. They [Russians] have made many sacrifices for us. So I personally lean towards them,” he said.

‘We will rely on ourselves’

Wondering why it had taken so long for the US and Vietnam to elevate their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership given that they became comprehensive partners a decade ago, Le Nam, a financial specialist based in Da Nang, told Al Jazeera he expected that closer relations with the US will give a jolt to Vietnam’s lagging economy.

While Vietnam’s position as China’s neighbour makes it difficult for the country to be seen visibly leaning towards the US, the new partnership would be “an opportunity for America to show its impact on Vietnam more visibly” in the coming years.





Nam said he was pinning his hopes on the two countries expanding their economic relations, which would have a favourable impact on Vietnam’s banking sector at a time of economic stagnation domestically and slowing trade globally.

Access to educational opportunities in terms of student exchange programmes and joint research with US institutions was on the mind of Cao Thanh Hien, 28, who is employed at a university in Hanoi.

Not a fan of Biden either, Thanh Hien said the current US president was, at least, an improvement on the chaos of the Trump presidency.

Biden might be “old”, Thanh Hien said, but he “does not cause a scene in the media like Trump and his policies”.

Thanh Hien also said she expected the comprehensive strategic partnership to bring benefits for Vietnam in terms of the South China Sea dispute.

“I think the US does want [Vietnam closer],” she said.

“In the South China Sea, the US is also wrangling for influence against China … On this matter, they [the US] will try to pull Vietnam closer, but Vietnam’s stance is always neutral – we will rely on ourselves.”"
"Revolut yet to file formal US banking licence application, over two years after saying it was submitting a draft application","{'href': 'https://tech.eu', 'title': 'Tech.eu'}","Fri, 15 Sep 2023 14:48:45 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5ldS8yMDIzLzA5LzE1L3Jldm9sdXQtYWJhbmRvbnMtdXMtYmFua2luZy1saWNlbmNlLWFwcGxpY2F0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5,"Revolut has yet to file a final application for a US banking licence, over two years after saying it was submitting a draft application for a US banking licence.

The UK-headquartered neobank, which is one of the UK’s most valuable fintechs, said in 2021 that it had submitted a draft application for a US banking licence.

Revolut said it filed a draft application with the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), the government agency that oversees the US banking industry, and California’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI), which regulates financial services in California, in January 2021.

Nik Storonsky, co-founder and CEO of Revolut, said at the time:

“A US banking licence would ultimately enable us to provide US customers with all the essential financial products and services they can expect from their primary bank including loans and deposits. “We’re on a mission to build the world’s first global financial super-app, and pursuing a US banking licence is an integral part of the journey.”

The FDIC told Tech.eu that it has no application on file from Revolut while the DFPI said it “never received a de novo bank charter application from Revolut”.

A search through the files of another regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), through which Monzo bid for a US licence and then withdrew its bid, shows Revolut has not made an application for a banking licence through it.

It is understood that Revolut is still weighing up whether to make a final application for a US banking charter, having submitted draft parts of an application and received feedback from regulators.

US banking charters are notoriously difficult to obtain, particularly for fintechs.

In the US, Revolut currently provides banking services through a partnership with Metropolitan Commercial Bank.

Revolut, which was last valued externally at $33 billion but is now thought to be worth around $18 billion, has over half a million retail customers in the US and employs over 150 people in North America.

Revolut launched in the US in 2020 with core features including a debit card and money transfer.

It has subsequently added to these services and this year launched a robo-advisor to automate investment portfolios on behalf of customers.

This year Revolut also said it would stop allowing US customers to access cryptocurrencies, citing the regulatory environment and crypto market uncertainty there.

In 2020, Varo Bank became the first consumer fintech in the US to secure a national bank charter from the OCC.

But stock-trading app Robinhood, payments firm Square and UK neobank Monzo have all withdrawn applications for various types of banking charter in recent years.

Revolut is still awaiting the outcome of whether it has been successful in being granted a UK banking licence.

Update (16:46 CEST, September 15, 2023): The article has been updated to reflect the fact that although Revolut has declined to comment on this issue, they still have not decided whether to launch a final banking application.

"SocGen open to sale of Equipment Finance unit in strategy review, sources say","{'href': 'https://www.reuters.com', 'title': 'Reuters'}","Fri, 15 Sep 2023 11:05:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvc29jZ2VuLW9wZW4tc2FsZS1lcXVpcG1lbnQtZmluYW5jZS11bml0LXN0cmF0ZWd5LXJldmlldy1zb3VyY2VzLTIwMjMtMDktMTQv0gEA?oc=5,"People walk past a logo of French bank Societe Generale in front of the company's skyscraper at the financial and business district of La Defense near Paris, France September 14, 2023.

LONDON/PARIS, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) is open to a sale of its Equipment Finance business as the French bank's new CEO Slawomir Krupa embarks on a broad strategic revamp, people familiar with the company told Reuters.

The bank sees the business as non-core, having sold part of its operations in 2020, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But a transaction may not happen soon because difficult market conditions weigh on the unit's valuation, they said.

Krupa, who will present SocGen's new strategic plan on Monday, will try to convince investors he can boost returns while setting achievable goals in a challenging environment marked by slowing economic growth.

The bank trades at about a third of its book value, almost on par with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) but half the multiple of its bigger French rival BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Italy's UniCredit (CRDI.MI), amid concerns about the company's exposure to more volatile income from investment banking.

A spokesperson for SocGen declined to comment.

Shares in SocGen were trading at 26.6 euros ($28.4) around 10.30 GMT on Friday, fairly flat from the previous close, implying a market cap of close to 22 billion euros.

The stock is one of the worst performers among the largest European listed banks over the last five years, having dropped 25% for the period, according to LSEG data.

Yet, the shares have gained some momentum in recent months, and a majority of analysts have a ""buy"" recommendation on the stock, suggesting the change in leadership has been received positively by the market ahead of the new strategic plan.

In his first remarks to analysts in his new role as CEO, Krupa said in August his management team had the responsibility of ""running a tight ship in terms of our portfolio of activities"" and would focus on ""long-term value creation"".

The comments were widely interpreted as a sign that he may shrink or sell some assets as part of his revamp.

While he is unlikely to commit to major sales of businesses at the upcoming investor day, Krupa may indicate an intention to prune non-core units over time, sources said.

Rather than naming non-core businesses, SocGen is more likely to outline the group's growth areas, said one person familiar with the bank's thinking.

Societe Generale Equipment Finance provides equipment leasing and financing solutions to manufacturers, dealers and vendors in sectors ranging from transport to industrials.

The business employed 1,400 people and had roughly 24 billion euros of loans outstanding at the end of last year, including partnerships, based on SocGen's latest annual figures.

SocGen is also said to be mulling options for its asset custody division, according to media reports.

The sale of assets would raise cash at a time when the industry as a whole faces additional requirements under global bank capital rules laid out by the Basel Committee of banking regulators that are due to take effect at the beginning of 2025.

One key question is whether Krupa can improve the 10% return on tangible equity set for 2025, analysts say. How he intends to manage costs will thus be keenly observed, they say.

Margins within SocGen's French banking retail unit will also continue to be squeezed until 2024 because of caps on lending rates and a government-imposed interest rate of 3% on the country's most popular savings account.

Remarks by Assistant Secretary for International Finance Brent Neiman at the Program on International Financial Systems’ U.S.-China Symposium in Hong Kong,"{'href': 'https://home.treasury.gov', 'title': 'Treasury'}","Fri, 15 Sep 2023 15:17:48 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZS50cmVhc3VyeS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9qeTE3MzXSAQA?oc=5,"As Prepared for Delivery

Thank you to the organizers at the Program on International Financial Systems (PIFS), Harvard Law School, and the China Development Research Foundation for hosting this “Symposium on Building the Financial System of the 21st Century: An Agenda for China and the United States.” Prior to joining the U.S. Treasury, I enjoyed teaching here in Hong Kong as an economics professor. I always admired the intense curiosity and respect for academics and analytical rigor that I found in my students. Not to mention my taste for dim sum, a love that even made it into my professional bio.

This symposium comes at a difficult but fascinating time for the global financial system, which has been charged with channeling massive amounts of capital to support the public sectors’ pandemic responses, has been stressed by the rapid tightening of financial conditions worldwide, and has been confronted by substantial technological change and innovation. It also comes at an important time for U.S.-Chinese economic relations, the recent course of which was charted late last year, when President Biden and President Xi met in Bali and tasked their teams with following up on a range of important issues.

In July, I accompanied Secretary Yellen on her trip to Beijing, where she reiterated the three key elements in our economic approach to China. First, the United States seeks healthy economic competition with China where both countries play by the rules of fair competition, a system that can foster growth and innovation and bring benefits to both countries. Second, the United States and China have a duty both to our own countries and to the world to cooperate and show leadership on important global challenges. And third, the United States will pursue targeted actions that protect our national security interests and will oppose policies that do not reflect our values, such as the recent steps taken in Hong Kong that have weakened social and political freedoms. We will protect human rights, and we will clearly communicate to the PRC our concerns about its behavior.

Secretary Yellen and I agree that it would be disastrous for both our countries were our economies to fully separate or “decouple.” After all, our economies are connected through trade in goods and services between the United States and China, which exceeded $750 billion last year. When we take actions to protect our national security, such as targeted sanctions against specific PRC companies identified as having provided support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, these measures are narrowly tailored to achieve our national security objectives. They are not used to stifle China’s economic development or to provide a competitive advantage to U.S. companies.

Similarly, our economies are connected through trade in assets, or investments made by U.S. households and firms into China and Chinese investment in U.S. assets. Both the United States and China are woven into the global financial system, and China’s total stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) is second in the world only to the United States. Moreover, the stock of bilateral FDI is also substantial, with U.S. FDI in China standing at over $120 billion and China’s stock of direct investment into the United States totaling nearly $30 billion. Members of the S&P 500 generate almost 8 percent of their revenue in mainland China, the biggest international source by far and a larger share than the next three countries combined. And around 250 Chinese companies are listed on U.S. exchanges with a total market capitalization of over half a trillion dollars. After accounting for positions intermediated through third countries, Americans in 2020 owned more than $1 trillion in the bonds and common equity of Chinese firms.

There are some restrictions to cross-border financial activity between our two countries, but as with our trade-based national security tools, our investment-based tools are narrowly scoped and not designed to achieve competitive advantage or to stifle China’s financial development. China’s financial restrictions are more extensive, in part based on its capital controls on inflows and outflows and in part based on its own national security framework. China’s increasing data security measures and restrictions on cross-border information flows also pose growing challenges for our financial institutions operating or investing in China.

The recently announced U.S. outbound investment executive order is one example of our small yard, high fence approach to protecting national security technologies. Last month, the President signed an Executive Order, or E.O., to address the national security threat to the United States from certain countries of concern that are engaged in comprehensive, long-term strategies to acquire and develop sensitive technologies critical for military, intelligence, surveillance, or cyber-enabled capabilities that threaten our national security. This policy action is designed to be narrow and address particular national security risks.

I want to emphasize that this program is not an attempt to financially decouple our economies or substantially change the investment climate between our two countries. And, I believe it was helpful that Secretary Yellen was able to deliver this same message, directly to her Chinese counterparts, during her trip to Beijing. She noted that China has for many years now had its own outbound investment regime, with relatively limited transparency, and she explained that any potential U.S. program would follow a highly transparent rule making process with a period in which comments could be submitted and considered. Being in a position to meet face-to-face, to clearly characterize the concerns underlying this action, but also to explain the careful steps taken to avoid unintended consequences, reduces the risk of misunderstanding. And whether we agree or disagree on a particular issue, reducing misunderstandings on new policy areas is in the interest of both countries.

The importance of having a channel to discuss each other’s economic approach and sharing technical assessments of global trends extends to financial policy broadly, including to financial regulation and supervision and efforts to preserve financial stability. After all, the financial stability of the United States and China depends on much more than cross-border holdings of debt and equity securities. The essential interconnections in the global financial system can be subtle or indirect, and the financial centers in our two countries, including Hong Kong, where we are meeting now, are disproportionately large and central nodes.

Financial stability, and the conversations among policymakers that underlie it, is a global public good that brings important benefits for the United States, for China, and for the rest of the world. After the global financial crisis of 2008, the G20 – a group that includes both China and the United States – established the Financial Stability Board, or FSB. It did so in recognition that maintaining financial stability requires both high-level political support and broad-based technical collaboration to identify vulnerabilities that could travel from one corner of the financial system to another, and to take coordinated steps to address those vulnerabilities before they result in a broader crisis.

Countries should invest in a baseline level of working relationships with their international financial counterparts. When crises happen, everyone is better off if regulators and other policymakers already know their counterparts and have an expectation of where and how to engage. As a complement to multilateral efforts, I believe bilateral discussions between officials responsible for financial stability, supervision, and regulation in the United States and China remain important, particularly given the size of our financial systems.

Take banking, for example. Hong Kong’s and China’s banking assets relative to their respective GDPs are among the highest globally. The United States has the second largest banking sector in the world by assets. Together, the United States and China account for over 40 percent of global banking assets. Of the 30 global systemically important banks, or G-SIBs, eight are headquartered in the United States and four are headquartered in China.

The recent stress at Credit Suisse, and its subsequent acquisition by UBS, should remind us of the critical importance of global coordination for the regulation and supervision of G-SIBs, in both going-concern and gone-concern settings. It is important for official sector authorities to discuss and refine recovery and resolution regimes, which are a pillar of post-2008 policy reforms and reflect a complex mix of legal, regulatory, and financial measures to minimize disruption to the financial system. The United States has held regular engagements with the United Kingdom and the European Union on identifying challenges with the resolution of a cross-border G-SIB for over a decade, and the knowledge-sharing that occurs not only improved our readiness for cross-border resolution but also improved our domestic capacity for large-bank resolution. Treasury is considering broadening these types of exchanges in order to include many more countries that are the home or host authority of G-SIBs, including Japan, Canada, and Switzerland. If we do in fact stand up something of this nature, China’s participation would be valuable to all participants, including China itself.

Earlier this year, the United States also experienced the failure of several regional banks. We took decisive and necessary actions to shore up public confidence in the banking system. Following these failures, the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC conducted self-assessments of their oversight of certain failed banks, which will help inform ways to improve our domestic bank regulation and supervision framework. Further, work continues at the international level to better understand the international dimension of the recent bank failures. We do not view this ongoing work, which is crucial to addressing specific issues, as calling into question the banking and resolution framework that was put into place following the global financial crisis. Indeed, these frameworks may well have prevented recent incidents from leading to broader stresses in the banking system.

Meanwhile, Chinese authorities are considering substantive changes to their domestic banking framework. Last year, China published a draft of a new Financial Stability Law which is, in our understanding, the first law in China intended to formalize a process for the resolution of systemic risks at financial institutions, rather than dealing with these incidents on a case-by-case basis. With both of our jurisdictions considering changes to domestic banking supervision and regulation in the pursuit of domestic financial stability, it would be mutually beneficial to share information on our evolving frameworks.

Also consider non-bank financial institutions, or NBFI, which form critical parts of both the U.S. and Chinese economies. NBFI includes segments of the financial system including money market funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital. It tends to be one of the most innovative parts of countries’ domestic financial sectors, but also tends to be an area where concentrated risk accumulates. Relative to banking, which has generally received more supervisory and regulatory attention over a longer period of time, the comparative complexity, opacity, and lack of data on NBFI makes oversight more difficult.

Addressing vulnerabilities in NBFI has been a priority in recent years, and the U.S. Treasury is committed to the FSB’s ambitious workplan to enhance the resilience of the sector. For example, in November 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission published proposed amendments to its current rules for open-end funds focused on addressing liquidity risk. And in July the SEC published its final money market funds rule, which will strengthen liquidity and reporting requirements. Treasury and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by Secretary Yellen, is also prioritizing addressing risks to U.S. financial stability posed by hedge funds. The Council has reestablished its Hedge Fund Working Group, which has developed an interagency risk-monitoring framework to assess hedge fund-related risks to U.S. financial stability. Though total global hedge fund assets are only around $7 trillion, some hedge funds pursue highly leveraged strategies that can pose a significant financial stability risk.

Chinese hedge fund assets have been growing quickly, now accounting for close to 15 percent of all global hedge fund assets according to the latest available statistics. In addition to being able to share best practices developed for our own domestic oversight of the hedge fund space, we could both benefit from a better understanding of each other’s approaches on NBFI, in part, because NBFI is another source of substantial, but difficult to trace economic interlinkages that have historically led to financial stability risks. Take, for example, the recent reduction by Chinese authorities in the minimum margin financing requirement ratio for securities investors from 100 percent to 80 percent. On the one hand, alongside the recent growth in domestic hedge fund assets, this could represent a new domestic vulnerability. On the other hand, a 100 percent minimum margin financing requirement for all equity securities is far higher than in most other countries, including what is generally required by U.S regulators. U.S. financial regulators would benefit from a better understanding of the intent of the policy shift, and given substantial experience working with lower margin requirements, can lend expertise to Chinese regulators as they update their risk modeling to account for the likely increase in financial leverage.

Both banks and non-bank financial institutions carry key exposures to real estate, an asset class commonly identified as posing among the most salient risks to current global financial stability. We are closely monitoring vulnerabilities in the U.S. commercial real estate (CRE) market. These pressures are elevated due in part to the after-effects of the Covid-19 pandemic – which has particularly reduced the demand for office properties. CRE analysts forecast substantial price declines for office space in the coming years, and according to some private data providers, we have already seen a double-digit decline in broader CRE prices. Banks hold an estimated 40 percent of the aggregate $4.5 trillion of CRE loans outstanding in the United States, with exposures concentrated in small and midsize banks.

The Chinese banking and non-bank system also have considerable exposures to real estate, with more than a quarter of total bank loans tied to the property sector and approximately 5 percent of the trust sector’s $3 trillion in assets directly linked to real estate. This year’s continued slowdown in Chinese property sales, combined with Chinese property developers’ high leverage, have strained some developers’ ability to repay their debts, with possible financial spillovers. We have, for example, seen recent stress in some trust companies, which can have opaque ties to local governments. These vulnerabilities are emerging against the backdrop of a slower-than-expected economic recovery—marked by both near-term growth headwinds and long-term structural challenges. This situation warrants close monitoring, especially as authorities balance the need to prevent a renewed buildup in debt against broader financial stability concerns.

Because of the significance of property investments across the financial sectors of both economies, a shared understanding of these issues would be useful for financial regulators. Direct comparisons are not the goal nor likely to be useful given significant differences in domestic exposures, regulations, and institutional features. Yet it is precisely these distinct features that can make regulatory and supervisory exchange useful. Chinese regulators would be better able to understand the challenges facing the U.S. CRE sector since the beginning of the pandemic, including the geographic distribution and cross-sectoral implications of those risks. Similarly, though Secretary Yellen has noted that the U.S. economy is well-placed to withstand spillovers from China’s economic slowdown and there are limited direct financial interlinkages between our financial systems, U.S. regulators would still benefit from a more thorough understanding of Chinese real estate conditions and of the recent measures taken to stimulate housing demand and to ease developers’ access to financing.

And beyond public-sector regulation of financial risk, it is also important for efficiency and stability that private investors have access to the information they need to conduct proper risk assessments. We are pleased that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has had complete access to inspect registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong since the signing of the Statement of Protocol with China last year. Oversight is critical to ensure that investors receive informative, accurate, and independent audit reports. But it is concerning that the Chinese government recently halted publication of some micro and macro data and have raided some corporate due diligence firms. Such actions may lead some companies to avoid certain investments in China – and such reduced transparency in the world’s second largest economy can increase risks and challenges for investors and policymakers globally. It is important for U.S. and Chinese regulators to be able to candidly discuss such concerns.

Next, consider financial market innovation. Digital assets and infrastructures built using new technologies may increasingly affect the evolution of commerce and finance across borders. Both the United States and China have an interest in fostering responsible innovation in this area and protecting their consumers, financial stability, and market integrity. In 2022, President Biden signed an Executive Order on the responsible development of digital assets which outlined a whole of government approach to achieve these objectives. The United States and China have also cooperated in the context of the FSB on development of the recently published high-level principles for regulation, supervision, and oversight of crypto-assets and global stablecoin arrangements. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Securities and Futures Commission are also pursuing a regulatory regime for crypto-assets to mitigate risks while promoting potential benefits of innovation.

In other parts of the digital asset ecosystem, official-sector activity may extend beyond regulation. For example, public sector authorities are experimenting and investing in new technology to support faster, cheaper, more transparent and more accessible payment systems. Robust standards in this area are essential – not just for monetary policy, financial stability and integrity, and the safety and soundness of financial institutions, but also related to issues like user privacy, financial inclusion, and private sector innovation. The United States believes the digital future of money should be grounded in transparency, sound economic governance, strong cyber-security and data protections, respect for individual rights, and the rule of law. We will continue to be transparent about our plans for the responsible development of digital assets and payments consistent with these values.

Finally, it is important that the United States and China communicate and coordinate on our approach to addressing climate-related financial risk, a key priority for Treasury under the Biden administration. In the United States, in China, and across the globe, climate-related phenomena, including warming temperatures, droughts, wildfires, pollution, and intensifying storms are already imposing significant costs on the public and on the economy. Further, the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council in 2021 identified climate change as an emerging and increasing threat to U.S. financial stability.

To help financial institutions in managing these risks, U.S. authorities are considering how to incorporate climate risk into regulatory and supervisory practices and into the monitoring of financial stability. At Treasury and throughout the U.S. government, we have supported data gap projects, scenario analysis exercises, and other domestic and multilateral efforts. Treasury has also long emphasized the importance of climate-related disclosures for protecting investors and giving them the information they need to price firm-level climate risk. Internationally, we have promoted the interoperability of climate-related disclosures to minimize unnecessary market fragmentation and reporting burdens.

The United States and China have both productively engaged on this front by, for example, participating in the Jurisdictional Working Group of the International Sustainability Standards Board, or ISSB. Further, Hong Kong regulators are in the process of developing a roadmap on evaluating the ISSB’s standards and the SEC’s rulemaking process to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosure for investors is ongoing. With an ISSB office open in Beijing, we remain interested in China’s potential next steps on disclosure as well. Dealing with climate-related financial risk is a global challenge and work is still at an early stage. China and the United States must engage on this work with each other and with other jurisdictions.

In fact, Treasury and our counterparts at the People’s Bank of China enjoy a productive working relationship as co-chairs of the G20’s Sustainable Finance Working Group, or SFWG. Together as leaders of the SFWG, the United States and China foster constructive, technical discussions that promote international policy coordination to integrate sustainability and climate considerations into global financial systems. We work together to help advance best practices to align global private capital flows with climate goals, including those outlined in the Paris Agreement.

The United States and China have the largest two economies in the world, supported by the largest two financial systems in the world. As Secretary Yellen has said, negotiating the contours of engagement between great powers is difficult. This challenge will differ across topics, but financial regulation and supervision strikes me as one natural area primed for progress. We have serious concerns and differences that we must acknowledge and deal with. But both of our countries are linked through our efforts on financial stability, bank and non-bank oversight, resilience and investor protection in the face of innovative financial technologies, and the financial implications of climate change. Discussions of financial policy, bilaterally and multilaterally, is an important component of responsible economic relations that can benefit the United States, China, and the rest of the world.

UPI has emerged as the clear winner, driving the exponential growth of digital payments in India.IMPS enables real-time interbank transfers and has played a significant role in promoting digital payments in India.The Aadhaar system, with its unique identification number for each citizen, has facilitated secure and efficient authentication in digital transactions.Account Aggregators allow individuals to consolidate their financial information from various sources, enhancing financial inclusion and enabling personalized services. By making financial data accessible to all, account aggregators have leveled the competitive landscape, simplifying the process for users to effortlessly compare products and services. They will play a vital role in the next stage of growth for fintech and it is going to extend beyond financial services also.India has witnessed a remarkable mobile revolution, with rapidly increasing mobile penetration and the availability of affordable data plans. The country has one of the lowest data usage charges globally, leading to a surge in mobile data consumption. Also, there has been an exponential increase in the adoption of smartphones in the country. This widespread access to mobile connectivity has paved the way for fintech companies and banks to reach users directly through mobile applications, enabling easy and seamless access to financial services.Banks have some inherent strengths, such as a trusted brand, an established customer base, and robust compliance frameworks. However, they can partner with fintech companies to leverage their agility, technological expertise, and customer-centric approach, thereby addressing niche problems and delivering innovative solutions.On the other hand, fintech companies are new-age technology first companies that thrive on disruption and solving existing problems. Fintechs’ strengths lie in identifying and solving specific use cases, utilizing advanced technologies and data analytics. While they bring innovation and customer-centricity. However, they do not have an extensive and loyal customer base.The partnership between banks and fintech companies brings together complementary strengths, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship. Some examples of successful partnerships in the Indian ecosystem include:The government's vision of a cashless economy and the RBI's progressive guidelines have played pivotal roles in shaping India's digital payment landscape. The government's favourable initiatives like Digital India, DigiDhan Mission and National Digital Literacy Mission have driven the adoption of digital payments. Recently , RBI launched the ‘Har Payment Digital’ initiative on the sidelines of the Digital Payments Awareness Week in March 2023.Digital payments have registered a significant growth in FY23, as per RBI-Digital Payments Index (DPI), driven by a significant growth in payment infrastructure and payment performance. Infact, India leads global digital payments with 89.5 million transactions in 2022, as per a recent data by MyGov. As per the data, in 2022, India accounted for 46% of the global real-time payments, adding that the digital payment transactions in India are more than the other four leading countries combined.While India has made significant progress in digital payments, there is still ample room for growth. There is scope for further innovation and adoption of digital payment solutions. To achieve mass adoption and financial inclusion, disruptive innovations are required, such as introducing sachet-sized products for insurance, investment, and making payments accessible on feature phones or IVR. Fintech companies' innovation capabilities and banks' understanding of compliance frameworks and customer trust are critical in driving this transformation.To conclude, India's journey towards a cashless economy has been marked by significant progress and accomplishments. The partnership between fintech companies and banks, supported by the government and RBI, plays a crucial role in building a robust payment infrastructure. Leveraging their respective strengths, fintech companies and banks can address customer needs, drive financial inclusion, and foster convenience and innovation in digital payments.As India continues to move in the right direction, with the government's vision and RBI's progressive guidelines, the opportunities for collaboration and growth in the digital payment ecosystem are vast. The future holds immense potential for India's transformation into a cashless economy, benefiting every Indian and driving the nation's overall growth and development."

"With Wide-Ranging New Sanctions, Treasury Targets Russian Military-Linked Elites and Industrial Base","{'href': 'https://home.treasury.gov', 'title': 'Treasury'}","Thu, 14 Sep 2023 14:30:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZS50cmVhc3VyeS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9qeTE3MzHSAQA?oc=5,"WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is imposing nearly 100 sanctions on Russian elites and Russia’s industrial base, financial institutions, and technology suppliers as the United States continues to leverage sanctions and economic restrictions to undermine Russia’s capacity to wage its war against Ukraine. The Department of State also designated more than 70 persons. Today’s sanctions focus on persons benefiting from, supporting, and sustaining Russia’s brutal war of choice against Ukraine.

“With today’s sanctions, the United States is continuing our relentless work to target Russia’s military supply chains and deprive Putin of the equipment, technology, and services he needs to wage his barbaric war on Ukraine,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “We have also made clear that those individuals and entities who profit from invasion and their proximity to the Kremlin will be held accountable, and today’s actions show our global reach in imposing severe costs on Putin’s oligarchs.”

IMPOSING COSTS ON RUSSIA’S WAR PROFITEERS

On August 11, 2023, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo said that “wealthy Russian elites should disabuse themselves of the notion that they can operate business as usual while the Kremlin wages war against the Ukrainian people.” Today, OFAC continues its efforts to target Russian elites and firms that benefit from their ties to Russia’s defense sector, military-industrial complex, and affiliation with the Kremlin.

Today, OFAC designated Russian oligarch Andrei Removich Bokarev (Bokarev), Bokarev’s wife Olga Vladimirovna Syrovatskaya (Syrovatskaya), and major Russian rolling stock manufacturer Transmashholding JSC (Transmash).

Since 2022, Bokarev has worked with assorted Trust and Corporate Service Providers to create shell companies, behavior that can be associated with money laundering. Bokarev has also been sanctioned by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom (UK).

"Disney asset sales won't break the bank, but they will move legacy media forward","{'href': 'https://www.cnbc.com', 'title': 'CNBC'}","Sun, 17 Sep 2023 12:00:01 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvMTcvZGlzbmV5LWFzc2V0LXNhbGVzLXdpbGwtbW92ZS1tZWRpYS1pbmR1c3RyeS1mb3J3YXJkLmh0bWzSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8wOS8xNy9kaXNuZXktYXNzZXQtc2FsZXMtd2lsbC1tb3ZlLW1lZGlhLWluZHVzdHJ5LWZvcndhcmQuaHRtbA?oc=5,"Chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company Bob Iger and Mickey Mouse look on before ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), November 27, 2017 in New York City.

Usually when a person or company sells something, the primary motivation is getting back as much money as possible.

Disney 's motivation to potentially sell ABC and its owned affiliates, linear cable networks and a minority stake in ESPN isn't predicated on what these assets will fetch in a sale. It's about signaling to investors the time has come to stop thinking about Disney as old media.

Disney's market capitalization is about $156 billion. The company has about $45 billion in debt. Selling assets can help the entertainment giant lower its leverage ratio while buffering the continued losses from its streaming businesses. Disney also could use the cash to help fund its likely acquisition of Comcast's minority stake in Hulu.

Still, that's not the prime rationale for why Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told CNBC in July he's contemplating selling off media assets — something he's long resisted. Rather, a sale of ABC and linear cable networks would be a message to the investment community: The era of traditional TV is over. Disney is ready for its next chapter.

""Disney almost has a good bank and a bad bank at this point,"" Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in a CNBC interview. ""Streaming is its future. It's its strongest asset, next to the parks. The linear business is something Disney has clearly signaled is going to be in decline. They're not looking to necessarily protect it. If they can move some of that lower, negative-growth business off of the books and to a better, more logical operator, we think that's good for the stock.""

Nexstar has held preliminary conversations with Disney to acquire ABC and its owned and operated affiliates, Bloomberg reported Thursday. Media mogul Byron Allen has made a preliminary offer to pay $10 billion for ABC and its affiliates along with cable networks FX and National Geographic, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Disney released a statement Thursday saying ""while we are open to considering a variety of strategic options for our linear businesses, at this time The Walt Disney Company has made no decision with respect to the divestiture of ABC or any other property and any report to that effect is unfounded."""

EBRD extends new risk-sharing facility with ProCredit Bank Ukraine

EBRD guarantees €30 million in loans to support lending to critical industries in Ukraine

Technical assistance and investment incentives funded by the European Union to promote SME competitiveness and preserve livelihoods

The European Union and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are expanding their cooperation with ProCredit Bank Ukraine by issuing new risk-sharing instruments and investment incentives with the bank, supporting continued access to finance for enterprises in Ukraine.

Under this new cooperation with ProCredit Bank, the EBRD is providing an unfunded risk sharing instrument to ProCredit Bank of €7.5 million to back up to 50% of the credit risk of €30 million in newly originated financing to private businesses in Ukraine by ProCredit Bank, subject to a portfolio cap of 50%.

Up to 15% of the risk shared sub-loans will be directed to small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) wishing to invest in EU compliant sustainable technologies. These SME investments will be supported by technical assistance and investment incentives funded by the European Union under the EU SME Competitiveness Programme, enhancing the competitiveness of Ukrainian SMEs on domestic and foreign markets.

The EBRD’s guarantee will help ProCredit Bank Ukraine to continue lending to Ukrainian private companies, operating in critical industries such as agriculture and agricultural services, transport and logistics, energy security, and retail. Ukrainian companies are in continuous need of liquidity support to finance their operations and regular equipment maintenance and renewal, particularly those operating in the import and export of goods. With access to financing severely constrained since the beginning of the war, the EBRD’s guarantee will allow ProCredit Bank to provide crucial support to Ukrainian enterprises and preserve livelihoods in the country during the ongoing war.

Background

JSC ProCredit Bank Ukraineis a 100%-owned subsidiary of ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA, and one of the market leaders in financing of small and medium-sized (SME) businesses in Ukraine. SMEs account for more than 98% of the bank’s loan book.

The EBRD, Ukraine’s biggest institutional investor, deployed €1.7 billion in Ukraine and mobilised a further €200 million from partner banks in 2022. The Bank has committed to deploy €3 billion there in 2022-23 and has so far mobilised €1.5 billion from international donors. The EBRD’s primary focus in Ukraine in war time is on maintaining energy and food security, restoring critical infrastructure at national and municipal level, providing trade finance and supporting the private sector.

The SME Competitiveness Programme is an EU-funded programme, which focuses on incentivising capex investments of highly advanced technologies and processes and encouraging best practice among successful growing businesses in order to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) active in the Eastern Partnership Countries can increase their competitiveness."
ModernFi and Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America Announce Partnership to Support and Accelerate Deposit Growth,"{'href': 'https://www.businesswire.com', 'title': 'Business Wire'}","Tue, 29 Aug 2023 13:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIzMDgyOTY0MDgzNy9lbi9Nb2Rlcm5GaS1hbmQtTWlkLVNpemUtQmFuay1Db2FsaXRpb24tb2YtQW1lcmljYS1Bbm5vdW5jZS1QYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC10by1TdXBwb3J0LWFuZC1BY2NlbGVyYXRlLURlcG9zaXQtR3Jvd3Ro0gEA?oc=5,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ModernFi, which operates a deposit network that helps banks grow, retain, and manage their deposit base, announced today it has formed a partnership with the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America (MBCA), a distinct and singularly-focused “self-help” alliance representing the nation's mid-size banks.

Across the country, mid-size banks provide financial solutions to entrepreneurs, professionals, their businesses, and their families. Mid-size banks fuel growth and build stronger connections to the communities in which they operate. The MBCA proudly serves as their voice and self-help network.

Deposit retention and growth have become key priorities for U.S. banks over the past year. Prompted by rising interest rates and magnified by recent bank turmoil, deposits have quickly left the banking sector. Small, mid-size, community, and regional banks have been disproportionately affected by the outflows.

Through ModernFi's network, banks can grow, retain, and manage their deposit base by sourcing deposits, sweeping funds, and providing extended insurance to depositors through program banks. ModernFi’s solutions help banks attract and retain large-value depositors, driving growth and increasing balance sheet stability. Unlike alternatives, ModernFi streamlines onboarding and operations for banks and their clients, increasing the usability and reach of sweep and reciprocal products.

Brent Tjarks, Executive Director at MBCA, said, “We’re pleased to partner with the ModernFi team to enable a more efficient deposit marketplace. America’s mid-size banks play a crucial role in meeting the credit needs and serving as catalysts for economic and job growth in towns across America. By allowing these banks to source cost-effective funding on demand and manage balance sheet size, ModernFi is fundamentally improving how mid-size banks across the country operate and who will therefore be even better able to serve Main Street businesses and consumers.”

ModernFi specifically works with small, mid-size, community, and regional banks to help them thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape and attract large-value deposits that might otherwise go to the largest banking institutions or leave the banking sector entirely.

“Mid-size banks form the backbone of the American economy,” said Paolo Bertolotti, CEO of ModernFi. “They are significant providers of capital to their areas and industries, and they provide essential banking services to their communities. Their contributions to the vitality and growth of their regions are indispensable. As the sector focuses on deposits, the ModernFi team is privileged to help the deposit growth and stability of mid-size banks across the country.”

The ModernFi and MBCA partnership brings ModernFi’s products and services to MBCA members and ensures close alignment and collaboration between the organizations. Moving forward, America’s mid-size banks are well positioned to continue helping their clients, colleagues, and communities flourish.

About ModernFi

ModernFi operates a deposit network that helps banks grow, retain, and manage their deposit base. Through ModernFi's network, banks can source deposits on demand, sweep excess funds, and provide extended insurance to depositors through program banks. ModernFi provides the software and integrations to streamline onboarding and operations for banks and their depositors, increasing the usability and reach of sweep and reciprocal programs.

About Mid-Size Bank Coalition

Founded in 2010, the MBCA is a distinct and singularly focused ""self-help"" community for America's mid-size banks. The MBCA provides a forum to facilitate the utilization of information, market developments and best practices tailored toward mid-size banks.

Big money, big data, and a big responsibility to say the least. Financial institutions lean increasingly on data and technology to better navigate fluctuations of the market, which can see dramatic shifts as well as slow-burn trends. For instance, a few weeks ago LG AI Research and Qraft Technologies signed an agreement at the New York Stock Exchange to support efforts in AI applications and the creation of financial instruments. They are clearly not alone in the race to leverage AI and machine learning in conjunction with financial data.

With an operation of Vanguard’s size and scope, using data and analytics becomes a priority to help maximize investments. A combination of co-locating data and analytics teams to work with leaders while centralizing data is part of Vanguard’s approach to advising its clients on their investments and reducing risk.

Ryan Swann, Vanguard’s chief data analytics officer, shares some of the data strategies and structure employed by his team to identify ways to further assist customers who invest through Vanguard by identifying behaviors that might leave money on the table.

TMGOC prides itself on its ability to identify high-potential lodging and multi-family projects ripe for either value-add opportunity or ground-up development in markets characterized by high barriers to entry and diverse demand drivers, the release stated.

“Since our founding, we have been intentional and deliberate in choosing our partners and our projects with a focus on opportunities that deliver long-term value to our stakeholders,” said co-founders and managing members Sunju Patel and Glenn Alba in the release. “This milestone is a testament to our shared vision and we’re eager to continue our expansion into new markets and opportunities.”

TMGOC is the brainchild of industry veterans Patel and Alba, who sought to create a firm that would best serve investors, capital markets and debt partners, the release stated.

Together, they’ve built a portfolio boasting 2,620 hotel keys in existing hotels and ground-up development pipeline across the country, along with opportunistic multi-family, office and retail investments, the release stated.

Alba, with his expertise in financing, asset management, valuations, and real estate disposition, has personally overseen more than $4 billion in hotel asset sales, the release stated. His career includes a 20-year tenure with Blackstone Real Estate, where he served as head of global portfolio management and led the asset management of the firm’s hotel investments in the United States.

Patel, an entrepreneur and visionary real estate leader, boasts more than 20 years of experience in investments, acquisitions, dispositions and both horizontal and vertical development, the release stated. He has a deep knowledge of the hospitality industry, honed by rising through the hotel ranks in Charleston.

TMGOC is also a magnet for top talent, as evidenced by the recent appointment of former Canyon Partners Real Estate executive Krystal England as the first chief investment officer, the release stated. Since joining, England has already helped double the firm’s portfolio and introduced new preferred equity and rescue capital offerings to its capabilities. Before joining TMGOC, England served as a Managing Director at Canyon Partners Real Estate in Los Angeles where she structured and deployed nearly $500 million and oversaw a $1.5 billion hospitality portfolio comprising both debt and equity positions.

Recent TMGOC developments include the recently opened Moxy Charleston Downtown, the first Moxy by Marriott in South Carolina. Additional projects underway include a 208-key Moxy by Marriott under construction in the heart of Uptown Charlotte, a 162-key Tapestry Collection by Hilton and 233-unit multi-family mixed-use development in Macon, Ga., a 191-key Thompson by Hyatt in Charleston, a 150-key and 20 residences Autograph Collection in Charleston, and a 100-key and 20 residences Ritz Carlton in Savannah.

TMGOC’s existing portfolio currently consists of properties primarily located in the Southeastern U.S., with plans to expand to additional key markets in Arizona, Colorado and Utah."

Direction from the regulator indeed addresses the classification of investments however other critical areas such as how to fair value of instruments in line with Ind AS 113 (Fair-value accounting), when to assess for reclassification, how to recognize any modification of the instruments, and when to derecognise the investments are yet to be addressed which are core and integral part of Ind AS 109 which at some point must be aligned for and by the banking sector.

The Reserve Bank of India has revised the current norms for the classification, valuation, and operation of investment portfolios of commercial banks.The revised directions include principle-based classification of an investment portfolio, tightening of regulations around transfers to/from held to maturity (HTM) category, and sales out of HTM, among others.As per the revised norms, banks must classify their entire investment portfolio (except investments in their own subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates) under three categories, viz., Held to Maturity (HTM), Available for Sale (AFS) and Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL). Held for Trading (HFT) must be a separate investment sub-category within FVTPL, the RBI said.The new norms, which are effective from April 1, 2024, and are in line with the global financial reporting standards, are expected to enhance the quality of banks' financial reporting, as well as improve disclosures.ETCFO spoke to experts to understand the implications of the revised accounting norms for the banking industry.“The revision in the norms by the RBI is a big step forward in the direction of mandating new accounting standards (Ind-As) for banks. There are three important pieces in the bank’s balance sheet i.e. investments, borrowings, and lending. Through these directions, the RBI has mandated banks to account for investment portfolios in line with the principles-based global financial reporting standards. This change will enhance the overall quality of financial reporting by the banks,” Venkateswaran Narayanan, Partner - Accounting & Reporting Consulting of Uniqus Consultech tells ETCFO.Ind-As, which are the Indian equivalent of stringent International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) have so far been implemented by all sectors including companies except insurance and banking. Their implementation has been deferred twice by the RBI citing pending legislative amendments as well as amid banks’ not-so-encouraging capital adequacy position in the wake of higher provisioning norms required by the new standards.Narayanan says the rollout of these directions now seems appropriate with banks today being in a relatively better position with respect to their profitability and also their recoveries have improved.“While banks have been submitting proforma Ind AS financial statements with RBI, there will be operational challenges in implementing the requirements of the circular. Banks will have to spend time in resources to make implementation a lot more robust by bringing in the rating processes, greater supervision by Boards, and by bringing in internal controls, etc. Those elements will have to be added to the overall framework of running the whole treasury management by banks in India,” adds Uniqus' expert.As per the new revision norms, banks must make their own internal credit analysis and credit rating even with respect to rated issues and must not entirely rely on the ratings of external credit rating agencies. Also, they are required to ensure robust internal credit rating systems which must also include building up of a system of regular (quarterly or half-yearly) tracking of the financial position of the issuer.Likewise, banks have to ensure that there are adequate internal control and audit procedures in place in regard to the conduct of the investment portfolio. For instance, they are required to take a half-yearly review (as of March 31 and September 30) of the investment portfolio and they must place that before their Boards within two months, i.e., by end-May and end-November, the revised norms state.Keyur Dave, Partner, Grant Thorton concurs saying, “The RBI is acting thoughtful of managing the transition to the Ind-As in a very smooth manner…Banks now must take steps of aligning systems, policies, Investments / future growth, board approval in line with the new direction of the regulator.”Dave stresses that there are still lots of areas currently that are not aligned with Ind AS- 109 (financial instruments) or the global equivalent standard IFRS 9.Experts feel now that the RBI has revised the accounting norms for investment portfolios, the next in line would be the final norms for expected credit loss (ECL) framework, another significant piece in the transition to the Indian accounting standards. The RBI already brought a discussion paper earlier this year in January and sought public comments.The ECL approach requires banks to estimate expected credit losses based on forward-looking estimations rather than wait for credit losses to be incurred before making corresponding loss provisions, which is the practice today. The ECL’s adoption would require banks to make higher provisions.“The sooner the RBI provides clarity on the expected credit loss framework, the better it will be for the banks to start gearing for the full transition to Ind AS. There are two elephants in the room, investments, and expected credit loss, one has been knocked off, and now is time to address the other. It does seem the regulator is preparing the banks to transition to Ind-As,” Uniqus' Narayanan signs off."

Reflecting on their experience, the group noted “the importance of communication”, and the “need to contextualise, synergise, and make sure we understand the needs of every stakeholder,” said group member Jefferson who worked on the project together with Zhao Jianxin, Lucas Tan and Priyanka Sancheti. In this way, they can leverage each other’s strengths and weaknesses to meet the needs of all stakeholders and contribute to making improvements that will benefit the planet.

SGFIN was set up to develop cutting-edge research and promote multidisciplinary educational programmes in the field of sustainable finance. One year since the launch of MSGF, we have taken stock of the lessons learnt. A key observation is that there must be an intentional effort to promote multidisciplinary training which also has to be backed up by rigorous research, in-depth industry knowledge, collaborations, and opportunities for students to step into real-world issues and challenges.

Secondly, we also find that the financial industry is still evolving in its investment and financing strategies given the fast-paced regulatory framework shifts and new policies. Hence, our students need to adapt to the changing environment fast and exercise critical thinking ability in many instances. These skillsets need to be deliberately developed through the curriculum and experiential learning throughout the entire master's programme.

We are excited about the various learning opportunities explored by our students, and look forward to the continuation of the hard work by our first cohort in their respective new working environments. Some of our graduates have already secured their new jobs in sustainable investment and consulting companies working on sustainability-related projects. Moreover, our second cohort has also embarked on their learning journey following discussions with the senior students during their presentations of the capstone projects at the Gallery Walk held in August 2023. Together with our industry partners, our colleagues from various parts of NUS will continue to be the key contributing forces for quality research and education to nurture the new generation of talents.

Treasury Sanctions Iranian Officials and Companies Connected to Repression in Advance of the Anniversary of Mahsa “Zhina” Amini’s Death,"{'href': 'https://home.treasury.gov', 'title': 'Treasury'}","Fri, 15 Sep 2023 13:30:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZS50cmVhc3VyeS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9qeTE3MzPSAQA?oc=5,"WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is designating 29 individuals and entities in connection with the Iranian regime’s violent suppression of nationwide protests following the death of Mahsa “Zhina” Amini in custody of its ‘Morality Police,’ and the regime’s continued efforts to detain dissenting voices and restrict access to a free and open internet. OFAC’s action targets: 18 key members of the regime’s security forces, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Law Enforcement Forces (LEF); the head of Iran’s Prisons Organization; three individuals and one company in connection with the regime’s systematic censorship and blocking of access to the internet; and three IRGC and regime-controlled media outlets––Fars News, Tasnim News and Press TV––and three senior officials. Today’s action is taken in coordination with partners from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and other partners who are also imposing sanctions on those involved in the Iranian regime’s repression.

“As we approach one year since Mahsa Amini’s tragic and senseless death in the custody of Iran’s so-called ‘Morality Police,’ we recall that the movement of men and women across Iran, inclusive of different faiths and ethnic groups, was met with horrific violence, mass incarceration, and systemic internet disruption by the Iranian regime,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson. “The United States, alongside the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and our other international allies and partners, will continue to take collective action against those who suppress Iranians’ exercise of their human rights.”

Today’s sanctions are OFAC’s 13th round of designations in connection with the protests that began in September 2022 and are taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13553, which imposes sanctions on certain persons with respect to serious human rights abuses by the Government of Iran; E.O. 13846, which authorizes sanctions on persons who engage in censorship or other activities with respect to Iran; and the counterterrorism authority E.O. 13224, as amended.

Concurrently, the Department of State is imposing visa restrictions on 13 Iranian officials and other individuals for their involvement in the detention or killing of peaceful protestors or inhibiting their rights to freedom of expression or assembly, including through censorship via a country-wide internet shutdown in Iran. Since Mahsa Amini’s death and the protests that followed, the Department of State has imposed visa restrictions on 40 Iranian officials and other individuals for their involvement in acts targeting peaceful protestors.

Leaders of Iran’s Security Forces

Iran’s security forces cracked down on the peaceful protests that began in September 2022 with horrific violence, killing more than 500 and injuring many more. LEF, commonly referred to as Iran’s national police, have historically played a key role in the regime’s brutal crackdown on protests, including those following the disputed 2009 presidential election and the nationwide protests in November 2019 that followed a gasoline price hike, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 protestors. The LEF has been linked to serious human rights abuses, such as the use of lethal force against peaceful protestors, including women and children, and the torture of detainees. The LEF has also led the crackdown on women and girls who have resisted Iran’s mandatory hijab laws and expanded an intimidation campaign against businesses and companies for allegedly not enforcing these laws. The LEF was designated pursuant to E.O. 13553 on June 9, 2011 for being responsible for or complicit in serious human rights abuses in Iran since the June 2009 disputed presidential election.

Saeed Montazerolmehdi (Montazerolmehdi)is Social Deputy and Spokesperson of the LEF. Montazerolmehdi has directly participated in the planning and announcement of strict LEF policies against women who disobey compulsory hijab rules.

Hossein Amjadian (Amjadian) commands the LEF Special Unit in Tehran and previously commanded the LEF Special Unit in Isfahan Province from 2016 to 2019. The LEF Special Units are the regime’s primary protest suppression force and have been responsible for serious human rights abuses throughout the country, including in November 2019 when security forces killed hundreds of Iranian protesters. The LEF Special Units were designated pursuant to E.O. 13553 on December 7, 2021 for being persons acting on behalf of the Government of Iran responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses against persons in Iran or Iranian citizens or residents, or the family members of the foregoing, on or after June 12, 2009, regardless of whether such abuses occurred in Iran.

Abbasali Mohammadian (Mohammadian) is the LEF Commander of Tehran Province.

Hassan Shahrestani (Shahrestani) is the LEF Commander of Mazandaran Province and was previously the head of Iran’s Morality Police. Shahrestani reportedly instructed his subordinates to “break the neck of anyone” violating Iran’s hijab rules, and reportedly warned that businesses whose employees removed their headscarves in the workplace face closure.

Ahmad Taheri (Taheri) commanded LEF forces in Sistan and Baluchistan province from October 2020 to November 2022. During his tenure, Taheri was the commander of LEF forces involved in the September 30, 2022 massacre of protesters and civilians in Zahedan, the capital of Sistan and Baluchistan Province, now known as “Bloody Friday.” On that day, the LEF and other security forces opened fire on protesters, killing by varying estimates between 60 and 100 people, including children, and wounding at least 350 others.

Ahmad Naderian (Naderian) is the Deputy LEF Commander of Sistan and Baluchistan Province and was the deputy LEF Commander during Bloody Friday.

Seyyed Khalil Safavi (Safavi) has commanded LEF forces in Rezvanshahr city in Gilan Province since February 2022. During his previous tenure as the LEF Commander of the city of Rasht in Gilan Province, forces under his command reportedly killed at least three individuals and injured several others during a September 21, 2022 demonstration.

Delavar Alghasi-Mehr (Alghasi-Mehr) is the LEF Commander of East Tehran Province. He was previously the LEF Commander of Shiraz city from 2016 to 2019 and then the LEF Commander of Ilam Province.

Mohammad Mozzami Goudarzi (Goudarzi) is the Commander of the Prevention Police of Tehran, a specialized branch of the LEF. During his previous tenure as Deputy LEF Chief of Karaj city in Alborz Province, Goudarzi was responsible for the brutal suppression of the November 2019 protests in Karaj. Goudarzi commanded forces who used lethal force resulting in the deaths of at least ten protesters.

Roham Bakhsh Habibi (Habibi) is the LEF Commander of Fars Province. During his previous tenure as LEF Commander in Fars Province, forces under Habibi’s control reportedly participated in the violent suppression of protests in November 2019.

Montazerolmehdi, Amjadian, Mohammadian, Shahrestani, Taheri, Naderian, Safavi, Alghasi-Mehr, Goudarzi, and Habibi are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13553 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Iran’s LEF.

The IRGC has also played a critical role in the regime’s efforts to violently suppress protests. IRGC units have used lethal force against peaceful protestors, subjected political opponents of the regime to beatings and electrocutions, prevented medical equipment and aid from reaching the wounded in hospitals, and committed numerous other heinous acts against the people of Iran. Treasury designated the IRGC pursuant to E.O. 13553 on June 9, 2011, and E.O. 13606 on April 23, 2012, in connection with the IRGC’s human rights abuses.

Khodarahm Sarani (Sarani) is the IRGC Commander in Zahedan. In February 2021, IRGC forces under Sarani’s command reportedly used lethal force against unarmed protesters in Zahedan, resulting in the deaths and injuries of a number of protesters, including a 13-year-old child. The IRGC also opened fire on fuel couriers protesting the IRGC-directed closing of a border crossing, killing at least 10 couriers.

Mazaher Majidi (Majidi) is the IRGC Commander in Hamedan Province and oversees units involved in protest suppression. Security forces in the province have used lethal force against protestors. Majidi publicly announced that in October 2022 alone, over 700 protestors were arrested in Hamedan Province.

Bahman Reyhani (Reyhani) is the IRGC Commander of Kermanshah Province and the Nabi Akram Corps. Reyhani commanded unitsreportedly tasked with suppressing dissent and protests, which they did brutally during the November 2019 protests throughout Iran; 1,230 people were reportedly arrested in Kermanshah during the November 2019. He also reportedly commanded IRGC units that attacked civilians protesting in Javanroud following the death of Mahsa Amini.

Jamal Shakarami (Shakarami) is an IRGC Commander in Ilam Province, an area where the IRGC has played a crucial role in suppressing dissidents and protests. On June 1, 2023, at least 20 people were injured in Ilam Province when security forces opened fire on crowds protesting the mysterious death of an individual after he was released from prison.

Mohammad Abdollahpour (Abdollahpour) is the Commander of Gilan Quds Brigade, a provincial branch of the IRGC. Abdollahpour participated in the enforcement of harsh police policies against women who disobeyed Iran’s mandatory hijab rules. He also reportedly supervised the IRGC’s suppression of protests following the death of Mahsa Amini.

Gholamhossein Gheib-Parvar (Gheib-Parvar) is the Deputy Commander of the IRGC in the Central Security headquarters of Imam Ali Security base.

Ali Akbar Pourjamshidian (Pourjamshidian) is the Commander of Hamzeh Seyyed al- Shohada Base of the IRGC Ground Forces and was previously the deputy coordinator of the IRGC Ground Forces.

Abdolreza Abedzadeh (Abedzadeh) is the newly appointed Commander of the U.S.-designated Khatam ol Anbia Gharargah Sazandegi Nooh (Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters), an IRGC-controlled construction conglomerate that undertakes multi-billion-dollar projects in the oil, petrochemical, and various infrastructure sectors, generating revenue for the IRGC and expanding its control across multiple industries.

Abdollahpour, Gheib-Parvar, Sarani, Pourjamshidian, Shakarami, Reyhani, and Majidiare being designated pursuant to E.O. 13553 having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the IRGC. Abedzadeh is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, for having acted for or on behalf of Khatam ol Anbia Gharargah Sazandegi Nooh.

Mass Detention, Torture, Other Ill-Treatment, and Sexual Violence in Iran’s Prisons

In addition to the use of lethal force by security forces, the Iranian regime’s response to the nationwide protests included mass arrests and detention, with protestors subject to various forms of mistreatment and abuse within Iran’s prison system. Tens of thousands of people, including children as young as 12, have been arrested, with many enduring brutal treatment while in custody. Detainees have been subjected to beatings, rape, and torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. More recently, in anticipation of the anniversary of Mahsa Amini’s death, Iranian authorities have proactively arrested activists in an effort to dissuade others from resuming anti-government protests.

Gholamali Mohammadi (Mohammadi)heads Iran’s Prisons Organization, a role in which he oversees the administration of all affairs related to Iran’s prisons and jails. Under his leadership, serious human rights abuses have occurred throughout Iranian prisons, including the use of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, detainment and physical abuse of political dissidents and religious minorities, sexual violence and coercion against female prisoners, including rape, and the abuse and torture of children. Under Mohammadi’s leadership, Iranian prison authorities have deliberately denied lifesaving healthcare to political prisoners, causing or contributing to deaths in custody, and have refused to investigate or provide any accountability for the deaths.

Mohammadi is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13553 for being an official of the Government of Iran or a person acting on behalf of the Government of Iran who is responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses against persons in Iran or Iranian citizens or residents, or the family members of the foregoing, on or after June 12, 2009, regardless of whether such abuses occurred in Iran.

Internet Disruption and Censorship

Another pillar of the regime’s strategy for protest suppression has been the widespread disruption of internet access. In addition to longstanding media censorship, Iranian authorities have responded to protests with widespread internet shutdowns, throttling connection speeds, and increasing the use of Internet filtering, such as blocking websites and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to limit communication and the sharing of information. Iran has also used digital technology to spy on and harass journalists and regime dissidents.

Alireza Abedinejad is the CEO of Douran Software Technologies (Douran), a leading company in Iran assisting the government in censorship and filtering of the Internet. Douran was designated pursuant to E.O. 13628 in 2014 for engaging in censorship or other activities that limit Iranians’ ability to exercise their freedom of expression and right to peaceful assembly since the June 2009 election. In coordination with the Committee to Determine Instances of Criminal Content (CDICC) — also known as the Iranian Filtering Committee — Douran blocks VPNs in Iran for the regime and acts as a “filtering contractor” for government agencies. A Douran subsidiary is also one of the leading providers of software in the development of Iran’s intranet, also known as the National Information Network (NIN). Amer Najafianpour and Soheila Kasaei are the Chair and Vicechair of Douran’s Board of Directors, respectively. Under their leadership, Douran has expanded its operations and played a critical role in the government’s censorship operations, specifically in blocking VPNs and other internet circumvention tools.

Abedinejad, Najafianpour, and Kasaei are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13846 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Douran Software Technologies.

Like Douran, Iran’s Yaftar Pazhohan Pishtaz Rayanesh (Yaftar) works with the CDICC to design and implement tools to “crawl” through the world’s leading search engines to identify and censor video and textual content that the CDICC deems criminal. Yaftar has also worked with the Iranian Attorney General’s Office to block VPNs.

Yaftar is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13846 for having engaged in censorship or other activities with respect to Iran on or after June 12, 2009, that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or assembly by citizens of Iran, or that limit access to print or broadcast media.

State-Controlled Media Organizations

Iran’s state-controlled media has played a key role in the regime’s suppression of protests, including those following the death of Mahsa Amini. Many of these organizations work in tandem with Iranian security and intelligence services, blurring the lines between government and media and extending the regime’s oppressive reach.

Press TV is the English language channel for the state broadcaster of the Iranian government, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), which was designated by the United States in 2013 for participating in censorship. Press TV has broadcasted scores of forced confessions and derogatory programs about Iranian activists, in many cases broadcasting forced confessions before detainee trials. Press TV has also been used by Iranian intelligence services to recruit sensitive assets, including U.S. persons.

Press TV is being designed pursuant to E.O. 13846 for being owned or controlled by, directly or indirectly, the IRIB.

Tasnim News Agency (Tasnim) is a news outlet founded by two IRGC commanders, Majid Gholizadeh and Hamidreza Moghadam Far, who continue to serve as Tasnim executives and exert control over Tasnim on behalf of the IRGC. Tasnim has supported the IRGC and other instruments of the regime in various ways, including suppressing dissent by helping the IRGC, Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security, and LEF to crowdsource the identities of protestors. Majid Gholizadeh, a former IRGC Commander, is Tasnim’s CEO, an important spokesperson for the news agency, and IRGC propagandist. Hamidreza Moghadam Far is the head of the Tasnim board of directors and an IRGC Commander. Hamidreza Moghadam Far has held multiple prominent roles in the IRGC, including as an advisor to IRGC Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami and the Cultural Deputy of the IRGC.

Tasnim is being designated pursuant to E.O 13553 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, the IRGC. Hamidreza Moghadam Far is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13553 for acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the IRGC. Majid Gholizadeh is being designated for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Tasnim News Agency.

Fars News Agency is closely affiliated with the IRGC and has provided special intelligence reports to Hossein Salami. Fars News Agency closely coordinated with the Basij Resistance Force (Basij) deputy commander on ongoing Iranian domestic concerns. The Basij, a paramilitary force subordinate to the IRGC, was designated pursuant to E.O. 13553 on June 9, 2011 for its involvement in the violent crackdowns and serious human rights abuses occurring in Iran following the disputed June 2009 presidential election. Fars News Agency was also founded by Hamidreza Moghadam Far, and its board of directors is chaired by Mohammad Mehdi Sayyari Zahan, the U.S.-designated deputy head of the IRGC Intelligence Organization. Payam Tirandaz is the CEO of Fars News Agency, a former member of the Basij, and a former employee of IRIB. Payam Tirandaz plays a pivotal role in Fars News Agency’s support to the IRGC’s malign activities.

Fars News Agency is being designated pursuant to E.O 13553, for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of the IRGC. Payam Tirandaz is being designated for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Fars News Agency.

"Banking industry turmoil could spur M&A, experts say","{'href': 'https://www.bankingdive.com', 'title': 'Banking Dive'}","Fri, 12 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtpbmdkaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JhbmtpbmctaW5kdXN0cnktdHVybW9pbC1tYS1leHBlcnRzLXNheS1qYW1pZS1kaW1vbi1maXJzdC1yZXB1YmxpYy82NTAxODgv0gEA?oc=5,"Turmoil in the financial industry, following a string of regional bank failures, could usher in an uptick in mergers and acquisitions, experts said.

Consolidation resulting from the failures and takeovers of struggling lenders has already kickstarted a lagging bank acquisition landscape. Regional lenders that survive the current headwinds, however, could be eyeing mergers as a strategic option to strengthen their positions in a tough market, said Ingmar Brömstrup, BCG’s North America lead of the financial institutions practice.

“M&A can provide a strategic option for banks to get back to higher return profiles,” Brömstrup said. “Certain players might look at the current environment as a true opportunity to get into attractive segments of the market.”

Brömstrup said the current landscape could also usher in a restructuring time, with some banks willing to sell certain portfolios, allowing stronger institutions the opportunity to consolidate positions.

“If certain regional banks need to focus on strengthening their current financial position, that could allow larger banks to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves in the market,” Brömstrup said.

However, consolidation may not be the best option for every struggling regional bank, said Joe Lynyak, a banking attorney at Dorsey & Whitney. A merger may expand a bank’s earnings base, but simply combining institutions may not necessarily solve all of a regional firm’s problems, he said.

With rising interest rates, many banks are facing unrecognized losses in their held-for-investment portfolios, Lynyak said. Many banks with significant exposure to the real estate market are also facing strains, he added.

“What type of consolidation is going to help a bank work through these issues? Is a merger going to be appropriate or is it really going to be holding the line and, down the line, when things calm down, raising more capital to be able to address two very significant longer term problems?”

Consolidation on the horizon?

""I'm already having knocks on my door,"" Mona Dajani, a partner at law firm Shearman & Sterling, told Reuters last week. ""A lot of the regional or smaller banks are looking at being acquired. We've also been approached by some big bulge bracket banks that are also looking to acquire the regional banks.”

Speculation that dealmaking could pick up in 2023 comes as the industry has seen a down year in bank M&A.

U.S. banks announced 167 mergers last year, with a total deal value of $22.62 billion, according to S&P Global. That’s the lowest yearly deal value since 2014, when announced tie-ups totaled $19.02 billion across 283 deals, according to S&P Global.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon weighed in on the M&A landscape during a call with analysts last week, telling them he believes bank consolidation is inevitable.

“[B]anks will consolidate. You're going to have all of that taking place,” he said, following his firm’s decision to acquire San Francisco-based First Republic Bank in a sale orchestrated by the FDIC.

Last week’s waiver from regulators that allowed JPMorgan to acquire the ailing regional bank was a notable concession, and has fueled speculation that regulators may have changed their tune when it comes to large bank consolidation.

For years, JPMorgan Chase, which holds more than 10% of the U.S.’s total bank deposits, has been restricted in its growth.

The bank has acquired plenty of nonbank firms in recent years, but the option to grow deposits through a traditional bank takeover has long been out of the question for the New York City-based lender.

As part of last week’s deal, JPMorgan will pay the FDIC $10.6 billion and take in roughly $173 billion of First Republic’s loans, $30 billion of securities and $92 billion in deposits

“The functioning of First Republic was essentially that of an extremely large private bank, which might prove to be very valuable for JPMorgan Chase — in particular, its high-end customer base,” Lynyak said. “JPMorgan Chase was able to acquire 84 new branches without having to deal with the merger limitations applicable to the largest U.S. banks.”

During last week’s call, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Ebrahim Poonawala asked Dimon if he thought the transaction signals regulators may view consolidation as a market solution to future stress in the banking sector.

“You should ask the bank regulators what their real view is of consolidation,” Dimon said.

Regulatory stance

In recent years, top banking regulators have said the approach to bank M&A is in need of a revamp.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced last year that it is working with the Justice Department and fellow bank regulators to review merger frameworks that may be seen as dated.

Without such enhancements, “there is an increased risk of approving mergers that diminish competition, hurt communities or present systemic risks,” Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu said.

The Biden administration has also zeroed in on consolidation in banking, issuing a July 2021 executive order demanding “more robust scrutiny” of mergers.

But the recent string of bank failures could mean the White House and regulators will need to change gears regarding bank M&A in the months ahead.

“If the stress continues, the banking regulators are going to have to permit M&A,” FDIC Vice Chairman Jonathan McKernan told The Wall Street Journal on Friday.

“Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face, and this mini-crisis could be the punch in the face that shifts the Biden administration’s restrictive thinking in bank consolidation,” Isaac Boltansky of financial-services firm BTIG, told the Journal."

US Gives Banks ‘Powerful’ Guidance for Partnering With Fintechs,"{'href': 'https://news.bloomberglaw.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg Law'}","Fri, 09 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5ibG9vbWJlcmdsYXcuY29tL2JhbmtpbmctbGF3L2ZlZHMtdW5pdGUtaW4tcG93ZXJmdWwtZ3VpZGFuY2Utb24tYmFuay1maW50ZWNoLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwc9IBAA?oc=5,"Banks now have a clearer roadmap from US regulators to ensure their financial technology partners comply with fair lending, privacy, and anti-money laundering laws.

The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency finalized long-awaited guidance this week on the due diligence banks are supposed to conduct before and after partnering with fintechs and other third-party vendors.

The guidance covers familiar ground laid out by regulators for banks working with vendors in more traditional areas, such as back-office functions, debt collection, and other processes. But the three main bank regulators are now highlighting the specific steps that banks must take to ensure fintechs, particularly smaller startups, are following federal law, said Jenny Lee, a Reed Smith LLP partner and former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau enforcement attorney.

“It’s pretty powerful, because the status quo before this guidance was a little more ambiguous,” Lee said.

The June 6 joint guidance aims to stop the gaming of financial regulations by laying out how banks are responsible for a fintech’s compliance failures. The guidance also explains what types of data that banks must obtain from fintechs to ensure compliance, and how to handle situations where a smaller fintech can’t provide the necessary information.

The rise of fintech has led to partnerships that are more customer-facing. In some instances, banks merely provide funding while an online fintech lender does the work of offering, underwriting, and servicing a loan.

Regulators are concerned that some bank-fintech partnerships have been used to skirt regulations.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu said in a November 2021 speech that he was worried about “regulatory arbitrage being facilitated” through some banking-as-a-service and “rent-a-charter” agreements between banks and fintechs.

Along with guidance, the regulators have taken a series of enforcement actions against banks for failing to appropriately police their fintech partners. In March, the FDIC issued a consent order with Cross River Bank for allegedly failing to monitor fintechs’ compliance with fair lending and privacy laws.

“There’s been an ongoing link between recent enforcement actions and expectations that banks really understand how their fintech partners are operating,” said Peter Dugas, an executive director at financial consultancy Capco.

The new guidance should provide sufficient clarity and make it easier for banks to understand their responsibilities under federal rules, said Phil Goldfeder, CEO of the American Fintech Council, a trade group.

“The updated guidance will help ensure that responsible bank-fintech partnerships and companies who are committed to compliance, transparency and accountability will continue to thrive,” he said.

Small Bank Challenges

Smaller banks and fintechs may have a harder time keeping up with the new guidelines.

Fed Governor Michelle W. Bowman voted against the final guidance, saying that it fails to “mitigate regulatory burden on smaller institutions.”

A Fed staff memo, which was released along with the third-party risk management guidance, said the three agencies will develop further policies that will make it easier for community banks to comply.

“We just have to see what the agencies do next with this because there are areas in here that have become a lot more prescriptive than the proposal was,” said Michael Nonaka, the co-chair of Covington & Burling LLP’s Financial Services Group.

Regulators gave more details in the final guidance about contracting with fintechs and working with smaller partners that can’t provide necessary compliance data, among other changes from the original July 2021 proposal.

Regulators will continue to keep a close eye on bank-fintech parterships, particularly with the increased use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in fintech apps.

“The regulators are very focused on making sure that while those products are being launched in the market that there’s also a careful attention paid to the fair lending laws,” Lee said."

Speech by Governor Bowman on the innovation imperative: modernizing traditional banking,"{'href': 'https://www.federalreserve.gov', 'title': 'Federal Reserve'}","Tue, 14 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZlZGVyYWxyZXNlcnZlLmdvdi9uZXdzZXZlbnRzL3NwZWVjaC9ib3dtYW4yMDIzMDMxNGEuaHRt0gEA?oc=5,"I would like to thank the ICBA for the invitation to speak with you today. It is a pleasure to be with you to discuss innovation in the U.S. financial system, the emerging trends that are shaping the industry, and the influence of regulatory approach on this evolution.1

Before turning to the main theme of my remarks, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the events of the past week, and the actions taken by regulators in response. As you are aware, last Friday, March 10, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed Silicon Valley Bank. On March 12, the New York Department of Financial Services closed Signature Bank. In both cases, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has been appointed as receiver. One significant factor leading to the stress and subsequent closure at each institution was the rapid outflow of deposits, specifically uninsured deposits above the FDIC-guaranteed amount of $250,000 per depositor, per account type.

On Sunday, several specific actions were announced that are intended to limit the direct and indirect risks to the U.S. financial system resulting from the closure of these two financial institutions. The Federal Reserve Board announced that it will make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions through a newly created Bank Term Funding Program.2 This program will offer one year loans to institutions that pledge U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. The facility will provide an additional source of liquidity to banks and eliminate the need for institutions to quickly sell these securities during a time of stress. The FDIC also took action to protect all depositors, including uninsured depositors, of both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Beginning Monday morning, these depositors were able to access all of their funds on deposit with these banks. The federal regulators, including the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen approved the actions to protect depositors.

The U.S. banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, with strong capital and liquidity throughout the system. The Board continues to carefully monitor developments in financial markets and across the financial system.

Now, turning to the main theme of my remarks today, I will discuss the imperative of fostering innovation in the banking system.

Often, when innovation is discussed within the context of the banking system, the focus is not on traditional banks engaged in core banking activities, like taking retail deposits and making loans. I think this perception misses the mark. Innovation has always been a priority for banks of all sizes and business models, from small community banks to the largest global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), and for good reason. Banks in the U.S. have a long history of developing and implementing new technologies. Innovation has the potential to make the banking and payments systems faster and more efficient, to bring new products and services to customers, and even to enhance safety and soundness. Yet, some have criticized the banking regulators for being hostile to innovation, at least when that innovation occurs within the regulated financial system. Regulators are continually learning about and adapting to new technologies, just as banks are, and regulators can play an important, complementary role, making the regulatory rules of the road clear and transparent to foster bank innovation.

Innovation does pose challenges within the regulated banking system, which can be amplified for community banks. Along with presenting new opportunities, innovation can introduce new risks and create new vulnerabilities. Banks, and really, any business today that adopts new technologies must be prepared to make corresponding improvements to manage these risks and vulnerabilities, including improvements to risk management, cybersecurity, and consumer compliance. Regulators must continue to promote efforts that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and in compliance with applicable laws, including consumer protection laws. As I am sure you appreciate, this is not always an easy task, and the regulatory response to innovation must reflect the changes in how banks engage in this process.

It is absolutely critical that innovation not distract banks and regulators from the traditional risks that are omnipresent in the business of banking, particularly credit, liquidity, concentration, and interest rate risk.3 These more traditional risks are present in all bank business models but can be especially acute for banks engaging in novel activities or exposed to new markets, including crypto-assets.4 Whatever the cause, many traditional risks can be mitigated with appropriate risk-management and liquidity planning practices, and effective supervision, and without stifling the ability of banks to innovate.

Today, I will address three issues related to innovation. First, I will briefly discuss how bank regulation and supervision can best support responsible innovation. Second, I will touch on the unique challenges that apply to smaller and community banks pursuing innovation. Finally, I will mention a few key actions that the federal banking regulators have taken to date, and how I think about future regulatory and supervisory actions to support innovation. And before I conclude, I will also quickly touch on a few other issues that may be of interest to you.

Supporting Responsible Innovation

In the past, I have spoken about the principles that I believe should guide bank regulation and supervision.5 I have noted the value of independenceâtempered by public accountabilityâin the Fed's role as a bank supervisor. I have also stressed the need for clear rules of engagement and predictability in the bank applications process. And I have emphasized that transparency of expectations in rules and guidance are critical to a bank regulatory system that is fair and efficient. I think these principles are instructive when it comes to how regulators should address innovation.

As both consumer needs and their preferences in accessing financial services change, so too must the banking industry. Banks of all sizes see new opportunities to develop enhanced and customized products for their customers, introduce faster payments, and improve efficiency.

If our goal is a banking system that leverages the many benefits of innovation, regulators need to make deliberate choices about how we regulate and supervise. Further, we need to be aware of and sensitive to the unintended consequences of our regulatory framework. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies have an important role to play in helping ensure banks can innovate in a safe and sound manner, and that role includes transparency in expectations. And of course, we must ensure that regulation and supervision do not place unnecessary burdens on small banks. The vast majority of banks want to meet regulatory expectations. By publishing clear guidance and developing tools to help assist these banks, regulators can improve regulatory transparency and facilitate compliance.

Transparency is a tool that can serve the supervisory goal of promoting a safe, sound, and fair banking system, particularly when it comes to innovation. In exercising supervisory and regulatory authority, the federal banking agencies must be aware of not only the risks to the U.S. financial system, but also the harm that can be caused to U.S. consumers and businesses when we don't achieve sufficient clarity and transparency in our expectations and when our regulations are disproportionately burdensome to the risks they are intended to address. With innovation, the risk is that a regulatory approach based on subjective, ad hoc judgmentsâas opposed to clear guidance and regulatory expectationsâcould cause new products and services to migrate to the shadow banking system. We have already seen a similar phenomenon in some markets, as with nonbank lending, which has proportionately increased when compared to bank lending in recent years.

A lack of transparency, and the corresponding limits on bank innovation, has adverse consequences for consumers, businesses, and communities. Therefore, it should be a regulatory priority to ensure our approach continues to support innovation that is conducted in a safe and sound manner and is consistent with applicable laws, including consumer protection.

The Innovation Challenges for Community Banks

I think everyone here today recognizes the valuable role that small banks play in the U.S. financial system, and just as important, in the communities they serve.6 Small banks provide credit and financial services to businesses and individuals through personalized services and relationship banking. Small banks have a deep commitment to their communities and understand their unique customers, including how they may weather the ups and downs of economic cycles.

If we look at the financial health of small banks today, we see an industry that is well-positioned to support economic growth. Across a broad range of metrics, including capital, liquidity, earnings, credit quality, and loan growth, small banks have been performing well.

But small banks also face unique challenges, especially when it comes to innovation. Small banks tend to have fewer resources to devote to these activities and fewer staff members with the technological expertise to develop products in-house. Therefore, small banks tend to be more reliant on third-party relationships to support innovation, including the critical relationship between small banks and their core service providers. However, third-party relationships can also increase operational risk, data security and cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and create other compliance issues. And of course, a bank's use of third parties does not diminish its responsibility with respect to the activities conducted by the third-party service provider.

I think the principles I mentioned earlier can be particularly relevant when thinking about how regulators can support small bank innovation. Transparency in expectations is important for the smallest banks, who may view innovation as a strategic priority, but may lack the resources of larger peers to engage in innovation and third-party partnerships or cover costs of legal advice to address ambiguous regulatory expectations. One way we can adopt a tailored approach is by providing additional resources and tools for smaller institutions to assist with compliance. Regulators have already successfully developed compliance tools. These include the Board's recently developed tools to assist community banks estimate their losses under the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, accounting standard. The federal banking agencies also published a guide for community banks on conducting due diligence for financial technology companies.7

I think these types of efforts are very important as we introduce new regulations and requirements. Clear guidance and practical implementation tools can reduce the burden of regulation while also promoting compliance.

The Evolving Regulatory Response to Innovation

Innovation allows banks to become more efficient and better meet customer demands. So, while bank regulators do not want to hinder innovation, we also have a responsibility to ensure that the banking industry adopts new technologies appropriately. To help balance these two goals, it is incumbent upon regulators to prioritize clear guidance to banks. Having clear (and public) regulatory expectations not only supports public accountability, but also gives banks greater flexibility to innovate and experiment with new technologies.

Across a range of activities, both banks and regulators are working to make innovation accessible to all banks, with clear guidance and additional tools and resources to help small banks. I'll now turn to a few specific examples where regulators have been working to develop transparency and clear expectations.

Crypto-asset activities

Many bank customers have expressed interest in crypto-assets over the past several years, with some banks exploring how they can meet this customer demand. There are a multitude of design and use cases for new and innovative technologies, such as distributed ledger technology and crypto-assets, which can pose unique challenges for regulators. The variability of these activities complicates the development of clear regulatory expectations around safety and soundness and risk management, and raises questions about legal permissibility. The lack of clear and timely regulatory guidance creates a real challenge for banks interested in exploring these activities.

Crypto-asset activities remain an important focus for the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators. While some banks continue to explore offering crypto-asset-related products and services to their customers, the extreme volatility of these assets creates significant challenges for banks. These assets also vary widely in terms of their structure, the markets for trading, and whether they are backed by any assets. Until clear statutory and regulatory parameters exist to govern these types of assets and the exchanges on which they are traded, I think some of the uncertainties about how the banking system can engage in crypto activities will remain unsettled.

While there is more to do, there have been some helpful initial steps to provide clarity on regulatory expectations. First, the Board published guidance clarifying that all state member banks should notify their lead supervisory point of contact prior to engaging in crypto-asset-related activities.8 The letter also clarified the broad requirements of a firm's obligations, including the need to analyze the legal permissibility of the activities, and to develop adequate systems, risk management, and controls to conduct these activities in a safe and sound manner and consistent with all applicable laws.

More recently, the bank regulators published additional guidance to highlight the risks of crypto-asset-related activities. In January, the federal agencies released a statement highlighting crypto-asset risks and recently issued a statement on liquidity risks resulting from crypto-asset market vulnerabilities.9 Federal Reserve staff continues to develop guidance on crypto-asset activities, including on custody, trade facilitation, loans collateralized by crypto-assets, and the issuance and distribution of stablecoins. I think these are critical next steps to provide clarity around regulatory expectations.

Third-party risk management

Third-party relationships can provide smaller banks access to new products, services, and technology. The scope of these partnerships can be quite broad, including fintech companies, partners who use the bank's ""Banking as a Service"" products, cloud service providers, and many others. But third-party partnerships designed to bring innovation into a bank can also create risk-management and due diligence challenges, particularly with respect to identifying the risks that a third-party partner may pose and to managing these risks.

For small banks, these compliance problems can be amplified by a number of factors. Small banks may have limited experience and in-house expertise conducting due diligence on third-party partners like fintech companies. And small banks likely have limited leverage in negotiating contracts and informational rights with third-party partners. Small banks may also encounter friction with nonbank partners who fail to understand the bank's ongoing responsibilities to ensure that even outsourced activities are conducted in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with consumer protection laws.

The Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies can play an important role in helping banks continue to innovate through third-party partnerships. Specifically, the agencies have been working to develop joint guidance to clarify regulatory expectations around third-party risk management, which will be an important step in supporting innovation built on third-party partnerships.

This guidance could be particularly helpful for small banks. But clearer guidance and regulatory expectations will not fully address these challenges. Guidance alone cannot address the challenges that a small bank faces in conducting due diligence on third parties and the difficulty in negotiating a contract with larger nonbank service providers and partners.

ICBA has taken some important first steps in determining if there are opportunities to fill these knowledge gaps by leveraging collective action to help with due diligence. In addition, some interesting preliminary work has been done to consider whether a standards-setting organization, in the form of a publicâprivate partnership, could expedite due diligence on third-party fintech partners. A centralized, standards-setting organization could help develop minimum standards to ensure better consistency in the diligence banks apply to these partnerships. I see a great deal of promise in these efforts, and I support continued work to develop these mechanisms to help small banks innovate through third-party partnerships. Another area in need of attention is in assisting small banks achieve similar treatment in their contracts in comparison to larger nonbank service providers and partners.

All banks should understand regulatory expectations with respect to due diligence, risk management, and ongoing compliance when engaging in third-party relationships. Banking regulators can support this approach by providing clear expectations and the tools smaller banks may need to help them meet these expectations. For example, in 2021 the Federal Reserve began providing state member banks with supervisory reports on their third-party partners that are subject to supervision under the Bank Service Company Act. These reports contain information that may provide helpful insight in assessing the performance of bank service providers, depending on the services used and the risk the services pose. As we are considering additional opportunities to provide resources in this space, your feedback and experience would be helpful to understand where we should focus our future efforts.

Bank service company oversight

Another area that complements third-party risk management is the agencies' regulatory authority over bank service companies. While banks who engage in partnerships with third parties continue to bear responsibility for due diligence and compliance, we should also consider whether the bank itself, or the third-party service provider, is best positioned to address risks.

The regulatory burden of third-party relationships falls heavily on banks (particularly small banks), and sometimes bleeds over to their core service providers, because the core service providers often make the technical changes to core systems to enable integration with innovative new products and services. Core service providers are already subject to activities-based supervision under the Bank Service Company Act. But with the expansion of third-party relationships, it is worth considering whether this allocation of responsibility remains sound, or whether additional partiesâlike fintechs and other technology companiesâshould be subject to closer scrutiny for the products and services they provide to banks. If third parties provide products and services to bank customers, it also may be appropriate for these providers to bear greater responsibility for their own products and services, including to ensure that they are provided in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with financial and consumer laws and regulations.

Cybersecurity

We do not often talk about cybersecurity in the context of innovation, but improving cybersecurity can complement innovation. When a bank is planning to develop new technology or pursue innovation, those new activities often bring new risks. As you know, bankers often refer to cybersecurity as one of the top risks facing the banking industry, and the Federal Reserve has issued guidance and examination procedures on a range of cybersecurity issues to help banks prepare for cyber events when they occur.

Cyber threats constantly evolve, and banks' cybersecurity efforts must be dynamic in response. Banks must respond to emerging threats by adapting risk-management practices, engaging with regulators and law enforcement when an attack occurs, and participating in training and exercises to ensure cyber preparedness. As I have noted in the past, the Federal Reserve continues to work closely with banks to support these efforts.10

Other Important Trends

Although I won't be able to take questions today, I would like to address a few other issues that may be of interest to this group related to bank regulation and supervision.

Community Reinvestment Act reform. As you all know, last May, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would amend the Community Reinvestment Act. The agencies received extensive comments on the proposal, including comments describing the costs and benefits of the proposal and how it would impact banks. Chair Powell noted last week that there is essentially agreement among the three agencies. While we are hard at work, it is expected that it will take some months to complete.

I am continuing to review and understand this proposal and the costs it will impose. From my perspective, it will be important to consider how the costs imposed by any final rule compare to the benefits of the rule, not just in the aggregate, but for institutions of different sizes and engaged in different banking activities.

Climate risk management and regulation. Climate risk-management and regulation efforts include the recent launch of a climate scenario exercise for the largest firms and a climate guidance proposal for a broader range of large firms. The Federal Reserve's role in this space is very limited and generally is confined to ensuring banks operate in a safe and sound manner, relying on appropriate risk management.

With respect to climate change risks, it is important to think carefully about the costs and benefits of any guidance and the scope such guidance may include. As proposed, the climate risk-management guidance would apply only to the largest firms. Of course, all banks below this threshold, including small banks, would remain subject to robust risk-management expectations, which includes managing all material risks. In many instances, these expectations may require banks to manage a range of related risks, especially from extreme weather and natural disasters.

Capital. As you know, the banking agencies are currently engaged in a holistic bank capital standards review and are working to implement the Basel III ""endgame"" reforms. With respect to the Basel III capital reforms, the agencies recently reaffirmed their commitment to implement these standards to strengthen the resilience of the U.S. financial system. As I think you all know, there are no plans to propose changes to the community bank capital framework as part of this capital review. It remains to be seen how broad the proposal will be, and for the larger firms, which firms will be affected.

Bank merger policy. There are significant consequences for firms when applications are not acted on in a timely manner, including increased operational risk, the additional expense associated with running two institutions in parallel over a longer period, employee retention issues, and perceived reputational risk. In my mind, this is an area that we need to improve; delays in the processing of applications are not exclusively an issue for large banks.

Small banks are also subject to timing issues when engaged in bank merger transactions. In fact, small banks that operate in more rural areas with few competitors who try to merge with other local banks can raise competitive concerns under the Federal Reserve's traditional merger standards. As I've previously noted, one way to improve the timing of small bank merger transactions is by considering all competitors when evaluating the competitive effects of mergers.11 In many rural markets, credit unions, farm credit system institutions, banks without a branch presence, and nonbank lenders can all be significant competitors in different product markets. In some cases, these smaller banks face greater issues in pursuing merger transactions than larger banks that operate in dense urban centers with many bank competitors. For all banks engaged in merger transactions, delays should be the exception, not the rule.

Efforts to support minority depository institutions. Minority depository institutions, or MDIs, play an important role in our financial system. MDIs often provide credit and financial services to low and moderate income and minority communities. The Federal Reserve is committed to preserving minority ownership of depository institutions, and providing technical assistance to MDIs, through the Fed's Partnership for Progress program. Federal Reserve staff frequently meets with MDI management teams to discuss emerging issues, provide technical assistance, explain supervisory guidance, and respond to management concerns. This engagement not only furthers our efforts to support these banks, but also provides valuable insight and feedback on the challenges facing MDIs. It is also an opportunity to gather feedback on regulatory proposals.

Overdraft fees. Banks often provide limited overdraft protection to customers and historically have charged a fee for this service. Recently, as you know, this practice has come under some regulatory scrutiny. For example, many banks have taken a close look at their practices to ensure that they are subject to appropriate disclosures and are operated in a way that is fair to consumers.

The Federal Reserve's approach in evaluating overdraft practices has been to prioritize compliance through the review of these practices, ongoing engagement with bank management, and most importantly, transparency in our regulatory expectations. Regulatory expectations should never come as a surprise to regulated institutions, and our examiners find that transparency is an effective tool to promote compliance.

I would like to address one specific overdraft practice that has been the focus of recent attentionâauthorize positive, settle negative (or APSN) transactions. These transactions occur when a bank authorizes a consumer's point-of-sale transaction based on sufficient funds in the consumer's account, but at the time the transaction posts, the consumer's account has insufficient funds. In some cases, the institution imposes an overdraft fee on the consumer when this occurs.

Over the past decade, the Federal Reserve has focused on this issue as part of our supervisory activities. For example, in July 2018, we published an article in the Consumer Compliance Supervision Bulletin that explained our concerns that charging consumers overdraft fees based on APSN can constitute an unfair practice.12

At the same time, we recognize that some of this risk is driven by system limitations of the core service providers, which can pose a real challenge to community banks confronting this issue in their own transaction processing operations. In some cases, core service providers need to implement changes to their systems to allow banks to avoid charging these fees. While this issue is a narrow one in the context of broader discussions about overdraft fees, it is important. We encourage banks to continue working with their service providers to implement fixes to system-based issues, and we encourage service providers to support their bank clients in providing compliant products.

Conclusion

Innovation has long been a high priority for banks, and I expect it will continue to be a key issue for the future. New technologies have created significant opportunities for banks to become more efficient and competitive and to provide improved products and services for customers. While innovation brings new opportunities, it also introduces additional risks.

But a transparent regulatory posture for these activities can help banks of all sizes embrace new technologies, to the benefit of their customers and the broader economy. The specific innovations I mentioned today only scratch the surface of the technologies and innovations that banks are exploring, which also include the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning; efforts to develop faster payments, clearing, and settlement technologies; and many others. For all areas of innovation that banks are interested in pursuing, regulators should continue to prioritize timely, clear, and transparent guidance.

I would like to again thank the ICBA for the invitation to speak to you today, and also to recognize the incredible commitment and efforts of the bankers in this room and beyond in support of their communities and the ongoing strength of the U.S. economy.

"New Treasury Report Assesses Opportunities, Challenges Facing Financial Sector Cloud-Based Technology Adoption","{'href': 'https://home.treasury.gov', 'title': 'Treasury'}","Wed, 08 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZS50cmVhc3VyeS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9qeTEyNTLSAQA?oc=5,"Treasury launches interagency Cloud Services Steering Committee to bolster regulatory and private sector cooperation

WASHINGTON—The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released a report on the potential benefits and challenges associated with the increasing trend of financial sector firms adopting cloud services technology. While cloud services can increase access and reliability for local communities as well as empower community banks to compete with financial technology firms, the report found that financial service firms ramping up their reliance on cloud-based technologies need more visibility, staff support, and cybersecurity incident response engagement from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). The report also recommends further evaluation from Treasury and the broader financial regulatory community to continue to determine the financial risks associated with a limited number of providers offering cloud services.

The first-of-its-kind report is the product of months of work in coordination with members of the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) and was developed with extensive input from U.S. regulators, private sector stakeholders, trade associations, and think tanks. The report does not impose any requirements and does not endorse or discourage the use of any specific provider or cloud services.

“There is no question that providing consumers with secure and reliable financial services means greater demand for cloud-based technologies,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “Treasury is committed to working with financial regulators, industry partners, and cloud service providers to drive greater collaboration and transparency. By building trust, cooperation, and collaboration at the outset, we can promote safe and effective migration for financial institutions that choose to adopt cloud services.”

In assessing the current state of cloud adoption in the financial sector, Treasury found that cloud services could help financial institutions become more resilient and secure, but that there were some significant challenges that could detract from these benefits. These include:

Insufficient transparency to support due diligence and monitoring by financial institutions. Community banks expressed concerns that they do not often receive details of incidents or outages impacting their systems. It is essential that financial institutions fully understand risks associated with cloud services so they can build their technology architecture with appropriate protections for consumers. While recognizing that CSPs provide significant information to financial institutions already, Treasury believes that further efforts are needed to achieve the right balance of information sharing between CSPs and financial institutions. Gaps in human capital and tools to securely deploy cloud services. The current talent pool needed to help financial firms tailor cloud services to better serve their customers and protect their information is well below demand. CSPs need to increase employee engagement experts, and to improve supportive technological tools and adoption frameworks that can help ensure that financial service firms design and maintain resilient, secure platforms for their customers. Exposure to potential operational incidents, including those originating at a CSP. Many financial institutions have expressed concern that a cyber vulnerability or incident at one CSP may potentially have a cascading impact across the broader financial sector. While cloud services can have potential benefits for resilience and security, financial institutions are still exposed to risks associated with technical vulnerabilities at CSPs and face practical challenges to mitigating such risks or migrating their operations to another provider. Potential impact of market concentration in cloud service offerings on the financial sector’s resilience. The current market is concentrated around a small number of CSPs, which means that if an incident occurs at one CSP, it could affect many financial sector clients concurrently. This concentration likely exists across banking, securities, and insurance markets, but Treasury and the financial regulators need to close significant data gaps to assess how the sector might be affected by this type of incident. Nonetheless, Treasury believes that there are opportunities to enhance cooperation among financial regulators and between the public and private sectors. Dynamics in contract negotiations given market concentration. The limited number of CSPs may give CSPs outsized bargaining power when contracting with financial institutions. This outsized negotiating advantage could limit the ability of financial institutions, particularly smaller financial institutions, from negotiating advantageous contractual terms for cloud services. International landscape and regulatory fragmentation. The patchwork of global regulatory and supervisory approaches to cloud technology can make it nearly impossible for U.S. financial institutions to adopt cloud consistently at a global scale, reducing CSP use in the market and raising costs for cloud adoption strategies, which ultimately impacts consumers. Additionally, changes in regulations abroad may subject CSPs to direct oversight by foreign financial regulators, which could create regulatory conflicts negatively impacting the quality and security of services to all CSP clients.

As part of addressing these challenges head on, Treasury has developed recommendations that may assist the financial sector in realizing the benefits of cloud services in a way that is safe, secure, and responsible. To execute these recommendations, Treasury will continue working with U.S. financial regulators and other agency partners, as well as financial firms and CSPs. It is also launching an interagency Cloud Services Steering Group within the next year that will address a number of the issues identified in the report through:

Closer domestic cooperation among U.S. regulators on cloud services.

Additional tabletop exercises with the private sector.

Development of best practices for cloud adoption frameworks and cloud contracts.

"Egypt: World Bank Group Launches New Partnership Framework to Support Green, Resilient, and Inclusive Development","{'href': 'https://www.worldbank.org', 'title': 'World Bank Group'}","Wed, 22 Mar 2023 08:47:43 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3JsZGJhbmsub3JnL2VuL25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS8yMDIzLzAzLzIxL2VneXB0LXdvcmxkLWJhbmstZ3JvdXAtbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLWZyYW1ld29yay10by1zdXBwb3J0LWdyZWVuLXJlc2lsaWVudC1hbmQtaW5jbHVzaXZlLWRldmVsb3BtZW500gEA?oc=5,"WASHINGTON, March 22, 2023 – The World Bank Group Board of Executive Directors yesterday approved a new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Egypt, laying out the World Bank Group’s strategy in the country for FY2023–2027.

The new CPF aligns with the Government of Egypt’s Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS), “Egypt Vision 2030,” and the National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) 2050.

The CPF builds upon a strong set of World Bank Group analytics, including the Systematic Country Diagnostic, the Country Private Sector Diagnostic and the Country Climate and Development Report.

""The Country Partnership Framework 2023 - 2027 between Egypt and the World Bank Group establishes a new phase of development cooperation and joint action to support efforts in achieving inclusive and sustainable growth. This is anchored in national objectives, the country’s 2030 vision and presidential initiatives. Through our extended partnership with the World Bank Group , more work will be done over the next 5 years to stimulate private sector engagement in development projects, increase job opportunities, enhance investment in human capital and promote climate action,” said Minister of International Cooperation and Governor of Egypt at the World Bank Group, H.E. Dr. Rania A. Al-Mashat.

“We are proud to continue our strategic partnership with Egypt and we are committed to supporting ongoing efforts dedicated to improving the quality of life for Egyptians. This CPF supports Egypt’s efforts to build back better by creating conditions for green, resilient, and inclusive development. It puts the Egyptian people at the center of its strategy, with a heavy focus on job creation by improving the business environment and leveling the playing field,” said Marina Wes, World Bank Country Director for Egypt, Yemen and Djibouti.

“The private sector plays a critical role in supporting the development of a green, resilient, and inclusive economy,” said Cheick-Oumar Sylla, IFC Regional Director for North Africa and the Horn of Africa. “This Country Partnership Framework demonstrates that when the private sector grows, people have access to more and better jobs – which ultimately helps them lead better lives.”

The CPF seeks to accomplish its objectives by achieving three high-level outcomes:

More and better private sector jobs: through supporting the creation of an empowering environment for private sector-led investments and job opportunities as well as creating a level playing field for the private sector. Enhanced human capital outcomes: through supporting the provision of inclusive, equitable and improved health and education services as well as effective social protection programs. Improved resilience to shocks: through strengthened macroeconomic management, and climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.

The CPF also intends to strengthen Egypt’s role in regional integration, which has positive implications for Egypt and potentially the broader region through enhanced regional trade and greater connectivity in infrastructure, transport, energy, and labor. Through the CPF the World Bank Group will also continue to support Egypt’s ambitions to lead the climate mitigation and adaptation agenda in the region, following the presidency of COP27.

Additionally, the CPF aims to integrate two cross-cutting themes—governance and citizen engagement, and women’s empowerment— across programs.

The CPF will be implemented jointly by the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), building on the three institutions’ current portfolios and adopting a flexible approach to lending. The CPF will be supported through a financial envelope of US$7 billion in lending (US$1 billion per year from IBRD and about US$2 billion during the entire CPF period from IFC), in addition to guarantees from MIGA. Partnerships remain a crucial component of the strategy.

The Ministry of International Cooperation, headed by H.E. Dr. Rania A. Al-Mashat, who is also the World Bank Group’s governor in Egypt, is the main governmental counterpart for the CPF’s planning, coordination and follow-up."

MongoDB Atlas for Financial Services

With changes in customer demands, regulatory compliance, and new players challenging incumbents, the financial services industry, which has traditionally been conservative in its adoption of new technology, is under increasing pressure to modernize applications and innovate consumer experiences. MongoDB Atlas is ideally built to help with this modernization, as well as enable organizations to build next-generation applications that take advantage of new technologies like generative AI. MongoDB Atlas also provides the resilience, scale, and highest levels of data privacy and regulatory compliance that MongoDB financial customers require.

As part of the MongoDB Atlas for Financial Services launch, MongoDB has achieved Amazon Web Services (AWS) Financial Services Competency . To obtain this competency, MongoDB was tested against strict security, operational, and reliability requirements, validating that MongoDB and AWS can help financial institutions get ideas to market faster, while reducing cost and enhancing business agility. This builds on MongoDB's long standing relationship with AWS, including MongoDB Atlas' availability in the AWS Marketplace. Additionally, MongoDB has become a critical foundation of the Temenos Banking Cloud, with a recent benchmark proving that together, Temenos and MongoDB can support the needs of even the largest global banks with exceptionally high performance while providing transparent data access through the JSON document model.

""Increasingly organizations in different industries are moving away from one-size-fits-all technology solutions to improve their competitive advantage and better serve customers. At MongoDB, we've built a team of experts with deep industry knowledge, many of whom used to be customers, so we are not only building better products with the right third party integrations, but our team can help customers get up and running faster,"" said Boris Bialek, Managing Director of Industry Solutions at MongoDB. ""Nineteen out of the top 20 banks in North America already use MongoDB in their infrastructure to solve some of their most critical problems. Launching Atlas for Industries is our commitment to continuing this level of dedication across financial services and other key industries.""

""MongoDB has been a trusted AWS Partner for eight years, giving customers running MongoDB Atlas on AWS a more powerful experience for building modern applications,"" Mona Chadha, Director, Infrastructure Partnerships, ISVs at AWS. ""Achieving the AWS Financial Services Competency reaffirms MongoDB's commitment to AWS and financial services customers, while demonstrating their breadth and depth of financial services expertise for use cases like fraud detection and real-time payments. With MongoDB Atlas on AWS, financial institutions can optimize to reduce costs in the short term while simultaneously transforming their infrastructure for long term growth to embrace emerging technologies such as machine learning and AI.""

Temenos is an open banking platform serving 3,000 banks, from the largest financial institutions to challenger and community banks, in over 150 countries. ""With partners like MongoDB, Temenos is becoming everyone's banking platform. A platform that allows banks to elastically scale based on business demand, provide composable banking capabilities on-demand at a low cost, while reducing their environmental impact,"" said Tony Coleman, Chief Technology Officer at Temenos. ""We recently conducted a performance benchmark with MongoDB proving the capability of Temenos' platform to power the world's biggest banks and their BaaS offerings with hundreds of millions of customers, efficiently and sustainably in the cloud.""

Wells Fargo is a leading financial services company with approximately $1.9 trillion in assets, serving one in three US households and more than 10% of small businesses in the US. ""When we look for new solutions it's not just about what the technology can enable us to do, but it is about finding a partner who can help us get the most out of the technology, with expertise in our industry, to help us work through our specific challenges and deliver solutions for our advisors and clients with agility,"" said Munish Kumar, Chief Information Officer of Wealth and Investment Management at Wells Fargo.

Michael Liersch, Head of Advice and Planning at Wells Fargo, agrees. ""MongoDB's experience in working with financial services organizations and as a leading developer data platform enables Wells Fargo to deliver innovative financial advice, like our new LifeSync platform, which provides a personalized digital approach to aligning our clients' goals with their money.""

A global leader in consulting and technology services, Capgemini has been enabling business transformation for more than 50 years and work with eight of the top 15 banks and nine of the top 15 diversified financial companies. ""Working together, Capgemini and MongoDB have been enabling business critical modernization and innovation initiatives in leading financial services customers across the world with a focus on increasing performance in a cost effective way,"" said Nilesh Vaidya, Global Industry Head - Retail Banking and Wealth Management at Capgemini. ""Our teams are also closely working together to meet new challenges that are on the horizon. We have developed unique accelerators and are actively designing the next generation of AI and ML enabled solutions to help our customers differentiate.""

Bendigo and Adelaide Bank is one of Australia's biggest banks, with more than 7,000 employees helping over 1.9 million customers. ""The expertise that MongoDB delivered from working with other large customers in financial services combined with the MongoDB Atlas developer data platform, was vital in helping us transform our organization for the future,"" said Matt Vermeer, Cloud Platforms Service Owner at Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. ""We believe our partnership with MongoDB will help us accelerate this continued transformation of our business, deliver our technology strategy, and ultimately grow our organization to achieve our vision of becoming Australia's bank of choice by feeding into the prosperity of customers and their communities.""

Swift explores blockchain interoperability to remove friction from tokenised asset settlement,"{'href': 'https://www.swift.com', 'title': 'SWIFT'}","Tue, 06 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN3aWZ0LmNvbS9uZXdzLWV2ZW50cy9uZXdzL3N3aWZ0LWV4cGxvcmVzLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4taW50ZXJvcGVyYWJpbGl0eS1yZW1vdmUtZnJpY3Rpb24tdG9rZW5pc2VkLWFzc2V0LXNldHRsZW1lbnTSAQA?oc=5,"Institutional investors increasingly are considering investments in tokenised assets as they seek new forms of value — but they face a complex challenge. These investments are tracked on a diverse range of blockchain networks that are not interoperable - each has its own functionality or liquidity profile, which creates significant overhead and friction in managing and trading the assets.

Overcoming this fragmentation will be key to the long-term scalability of the market and, aligned with our focus on removing friction in international transactions, we are working with our community to explore a potential solution. In a new set of experiments, we will collaborate with more than a dozen major financial institutions and FMIs including Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ), BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, Citi, Clearstream, Euroclear, Lloyds Banking Group, SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) – to test how firms can leverage their existing Swift infrastructure to efficiently instruct the transfer of tokenised value over a range of public and private blockchain networks. Chainlink, a leading Web3 services platform, will provide connectivity across public and private blockchains for these experiments.

This latest round of experimentation builds on a series of successful trials in 2022, and also will explore how the industry could address potential operational and regulatory pitfalls facing financial institutions when operating in blockchain environment.

Investors and intermediaries face a blockchain challenge

In capital markets, there’s a growing view that blockchain technology has the potential to generate efficiencies, reduce costs and open up opportunities for some parts of the industry. For example, private markets have historically been dependent on legacy systems and processes, which add costs and deter investment. By rationalising operations and settlement processes, blockchain could attract more investors into the private markets and ultimately increase liquidity.

However, trading tokenised assets is still a niche activity in the regulated space. For the market to scale, financial institutions need to be able to easily interact with multiple blockchain-based networks in a secure and trusted way, just as they do today when facilitating the trading of traditional assets."
Grasshopper Bank leans on fintech partners to weather economic downturn,"{'href': 'https://www.bankingdive.com', 'title': 'Banking Dive'}","Wed, 08 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtpbmdkaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dyYXNzaG9wcGVyLWJhbmstZmludGVjaC1wYXJ0bmVycy1lY29ub21pYy1kb3dudHVybi1taWtlLWJ1dGxlci82NDQ1MDYv0gEA?oc=5,"Since joining New York City-based Grasshopper Bank in 2021, CEO Mike Butler has overhauled the bank’s tech stack to offer banking as a service and serve small business clients.

In 2022, under the former Radius Bank CEO’s supervision, the more than $600 million-asset bank rebuilt its technology platform to focus on fintech partnerships. Since the revamp, the bank has secured deals with Treasury Prime, FIS, Narmi, Alloy, Visa, Autobooks, Hummingbird and Fiverity.

Grasshopper’s partnership with FIS and Treasury Prime helped it to become the first financial institution to tap into FIS’ embedded finance services and serve as the pilot bank in building out its BaaS and corporate application program interface platform, according to the firm.

In January, Grasshopper announced a partnership with Ramp, a leading corporate card and finance automation platform and with MANTL, an account origination solutions provider. The bank offers small and midsize business clients access to Ramp’s platform, including its virtual and physical corporate cards based on referrals. The collaboration will give small businesses a holistic view of their finances in one place, the bank said.

Grasshopper on Wednesday reported a 262% uptick in loans and a 124% increase in deposits, while total revenues exceeded $17 million — a 239% increase, year over year.

Grasshopper’s hiring saw a 31% boost since the start of 2022.

“Despite some economic headwinds, the market for our digital solutions continues to grow rapidly, and we will continue to work tirelessly to make sure that our clients have the exceptional digital banking experience they deserve and demand,” Butler said in a statement. “To do that, we will continue to partner with industry-leading fintech companies that help extend our capabilities and develop business lines that directly meet the needs of small and mid-sized businesses.”

This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Banking Dive: What hurdles are you facing during this economic downturn?

MIKE BUTLER: I think the No. 1 hurdle always is motivating people. It is a very big

Grasshopper Bank CEO Mike Butler Permission granted by Grasshopper Bank

challenge, especially in a startup where there's a lot of hard work and the pay is down the road.

[Second is] working with partners, and we're a partnership shop. So, we don't develop our own software. We've committed to embracing the fintech world as companies that we think create superior technology in a faster and more of an open architecture way. But working with partners to execute these strategies are also fairly big hurdles for us.

And I think the last one is .... the regulatory environment has gotten a bit strict. [T]hat has become a challenge and we spend more time with that, but you have to make sure that it doesn't become a distraction, and that you're operating within the safety and soundness guidelines of regulators.

What is your approach to fintech partnerships?

BUTLER: We feel like it's one of our true strengths. We understand partnerships. And the one thing that I tell people is, once you try and refer to one of your fintech partners as a vendor, then you're in a bad place. We like to limit the number of partners that we have to engage with and pick the best that we possibly can that are aligned to us.

We do a great deal of due diligence upfront [with] our partners and understand their ability to work within our culture. Because that's important for us. You've got to be aligned to our culture.

How many partners do you prefer to work with at a given time?

BUTLER: There are two parts to this. We use fintech for our platform, which creates the customer experience that we think is critically important to serving the demands of the digital kind of client. And then we also have our banking-as-a-service business in which we provide white label solutions to companies that can benefit from a banking product. On the platform side, we'd say four to five partners is the [maximum] we've ever worked with. And in the banking-as-a-service side, we'd like to say 15 to 20 fintechs is all we really want to partner with.

How do you stand apart from the rest in the market?

BUTLER: Our fintech partners deliver what we expect them to deliver and that's a customer experience that delights our clients. And we think that is always a differentiator to client acquisition."
Federal Reserve names organizations certified as ready for FedNow® Service,"{'href': 'https://www.federalreserve.gov', 'title': 'Federal Reserve'}","Thu, 29 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZlZGVyYWxyZXNlcnZlLmdvdi9uZXdzZXZlbnRzL3ByZXNzcmVsZWFzZXMvb3RoZXIyMDIzMDYyOWEuaHRt0gEA?oc=5,"CHICAGO â The Federal Reserve announced that 57 early adopter organizations, including financial institutions and service providers, have completed formal testing and certification in advance of the FedNow Service's launch planned for late July. Many of these organizations will be live when the FedNow Service launches or shortly after, with financial institutions ready to send and receive transactions and service providers ready to support transaction activity.

This group of early adopters is now performing final trial runs on the service to confirm their readiness to support live transactions over the new instant payments infrastructure. The early adopters include 41 financial institutions participating as senders, receivers and/or correspondents supporting settlement, 15 service providers processing on behalf of participants, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

""We are on track for the FedNow Service launch, with a strong cohort of financial institutions and service providers of all sizes in the process of completing the final round of readiness testing,"" said Ken Montgomery, first vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and FedNow program executive. ""With go-live nearing, financial institutions and their industry partners should be confident in moving forward with plans to join the network of organizations participating in the FedNow Service.""

Over time, financial institutions are expected to adopt and build on the FedNow Service with the goal of offering new instant payments services to their customers. Montgomery noted that as a platform for innovation, the FedNow Service is intended to support multiple use cases, such as account to account transfer, request for payment, bill pay, and many others.

In addition to working with early adopters, the Federal Reserve continues to work with and onboard financial institutions planning to join later in 2023 and beyond, as the initial step to growing a robust network aiming to reach all 10,000 U.S. financial institutions.

About the FedNow Service

The Federal Reserve Banks are developing the FedNow Service to facilitate nationwide reach of instant payment services by financial institutions â regardless of size or geographic location â around the clock, every day of the year. Through financial institutions participating in the FedNow Service, businesses and individuals will be able to send and receive instant payments at any time of day, and recipients will have full access to funds immediately, giving them greater flexibility to manage their money and make time-sensitive payments. Access will be provided through the Federal Reserve's FedLine® network, which serves more than 10,000 financial institutions directly or through their agents.

Binance announced the change late Thursday night on Twitter and blamed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ""unjustified civil claims against our business."" The exchange said it had preemptively disabled customers' ability to buy and deposit U.S. dollars.

Binance's banking transactions are the center of immense scrutiny by the SEC, which filed a civil complaint against the exchange and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, alleging both violated U.S. securities laws.

Zhao's influence over and ownership of the U.S. and international arms of Binance — an international network of offshore holding companies the SEC alleges have moved billions of dollars of assets between themselves — prompted the SEC to file an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. That restraining order would have frozen U.S. dollars from the exchange anyway.

Customers won't lose their money. Those who haven't withdrawn their money by the shutdown date could still theoretically convert it to a stablecoin such as tether, then withdraw that and convert it back to dollars elsewhere. But it suggests Binance's banking partners have decided the exchange is too risky a client to keep on, and that the revelations from the SEC case have grown too significant to ignore.

The exchange's disclosed U.S. banking partners, which have included Axos Bank, Cross River Bank and the failed Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks, processed billions of dollars in transactions for the U.S. exchange, according to documents Binance provided to the SEC. Multiple banking partners had already stopped serving Binance and it wasn't immediately clear which banking partners Binance retained."

Moody's cut the ratings of 10 banks by one notch and placed six banking giants, including Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), US Bancorp (USB.N), State Street (STT.N) and Truist Financial (TFC.N) on review for potential downgrades.

""Many banks' second-quarter results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital,"" Moody's said in a note.

""This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE)portfolios.""

Moody's said elevated CRE exposures are a key risk due to high interest rates, declines in office demand as a result of remote work, and a reduction in the availability of CRE credit.

The agency also changed its outlook to negative for eleven major lenders, including Capital One (COF.N), Citizens Financial (CFG.N) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O).

The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier this year sparked a crisis of confidence in the U.S. banking sector, leading to a run on deposits at a host of regional banks despite authorities launching emergency measures to shore up confidence.

Still, Moody's cautioned that banks with sizable unrealized losses that are not reflected in their regulatory capital ratios are vulnerable to a loss of confidence in the current high-rate environment.

The sweeping report comes against the backdrop of tightening monetary conditions after the fastest pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve in decades slows demand and borrowing.

The higher rates have also raised the spectre of recession and put pressure on sectors such as real estate to adjust to post-pandemic realities.

Federal Reserve survey data released last week showed U.S. banks reported tighter credit standards and weaker loan demand from both businesses and consumers during the second quarter.

Morgan Stanley analysts said the loan demand is likely to continue to weaken, with the rate of change slowing further.

Rating agency peer Fitch has downgraded the United States by a notch to AA+ due to fiscal deterioration over the next three years and repeated down-to-the-wire debt ceiling negotiations.

The downgraded banks by Moody's include M&T Bank (MTB.N), Pinnacle Financial Partners (PNFP.O), Prosperity Bank and BOK Financial Corp (BOKF.O).

Citizens partners with Wisetack on BNPL loans for SMBs,"{'href': 'https://www.bankingdive.com', 'title': 'Banking Dive'}","Wed, 21 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtpbmdkaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NpdGl6ZW5zLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtd2lzZXRhY2stb24tYm5wbC1sb2Fucy1mb3Itc21icy82NTM1NTcv0gEA?oc=5,"Citizens expanded its point-of-sale offerings for small businesses by partnering with embedded pay over time platform Wisetack to offer more flexible financing options for the fintech’s customers.

Citizens announced last week that its consumer installment financing solution, Citizens Pay, will offer pay over time options for home improvement projects through Wisetack’s network of merchants and software as service integrations.

The partnership will initially focus on buy now pay later loans for consumers looking to make critical purchases like home repairs, improvements and maintenance with end-to-end solutions.

“One of the areas that we really felt a need to explore is how do we help small business owners more. I do believe that small business lending either from a point-of-sale perspective or in support of small businesses is … the next consumer need. Small business owners are consumers, as well,” said Christine Roberts, president of Citizens Pay.

“So how can we start to help our small business owners in a way that helps drive their business while also helping consumers?” she added.

Citizens Pay has been an established business platform since 2015, with large technology merchants as clients like Apple, Best Buy, Microsoft and Vivint.

Founded in 2018 and based in San Francisco, Wisetack is an alternative to borrowing on credit cards at a much lower cost, Bobby Tzekin, co-founder and CEO of Wisetack, said.

While the fintech’s network and technology helped to onboard a $222 billion-asset bank to provide financing and lend to consumers, the partnership is “the best of both worlds,” Tzekin noted.

Wisetack’s secured and structured platform has no “cross-pollination between the owner and the consumer information,” Roberts pointed out. It operates within all the appropriate rules and regulations, she added.

Wisetack bridges the gap between borrowers and lenders and offers BNPL loans to consumers directly on the spot with installment payments spread across three months to five years. The fintech’s clients typically use mobile devices, apps or emails to extend their offer to the consumers, Tzekin said.

The fintech offers loans through platforms like Housecall Pro, Thumbtack, Thryv, Jobber, and Signpost, according to its website.

Citizens is the first large bank that Wisetack has partnered with, but it plans to add more to its partner list, Tzekin said. Until now, Wisetack has worked with smaller banks like San Marcos, California-based Hatch Bank, which has around $178 million in assets.

“When it comes to Citizens, they are one of the largest U.S. banks, and they are very forward thinking,” said Tzekin, who headed the product division at Lending Club and, more recently, at Mosaic. “So I think not only is the scale sufficient for us to continue to work with them for a long time as we grow, but I think we're going to end up finding other ways to make the partnership deeper, like launching additional joint products would certainly be something that we'll be evaluating,” he added.

Citizens, a lender in the market for 200 years, will be pushing into the small business space, which has around 33 million small business owners in the country lacking a proper platform to channel their needs, Roberts noted.

“Especially from a home improvement standpoint, given the interest rate environment, as we all see, fewer homes are going on the market, and more people are going to invest within their current home to stay for a while longer,” she pointed out.

Making an offer through a contractor is a great way to reach out to consumers, she added.

A symbiotic relationship

Citizens has a substantial small-business banking program, and the lender is working toward delivering point-of-sale solutions for small businesses as well, Roberts said.

“It has now become apparent to the fintechs that the banks have opportunities to be the backbone of lending and/or financial services. And then [the fintechs] get to be the frontman,” she said.

Though Citizens has a sizeable internal tech department, she noted that their focus is primarily to grow the bank’s technology as an enterprise.

Fintechs have creativity, technology, faster delivery and application programming interfaces – the infrastructures that Citizens lacks, Roberts pointed out.

“That can be a very symbiotic relationship. We bring the capabilities of a massive institution of lending and regulatory control. They bring the creativity of fintech and customer experience and technological connectivity together,” she said."

First Fidelity Bank enters BaaS space with Episode Six partnership,"{'href': 'https://www.bankingdive.com', 'title': 'Banking Dive'}","Wed, 01 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtpbmdkaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpcnN0LWZpZGVsaXR5LWJhbmstZW50ZXJzLWJhYXMtc3BhY2Utd2l0aC1lcGlzb2RlLXNpeC1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC82NDM5MTMv0gEA?oc=5,"First Fidelity Bank, a 100-year-old community bank, is entering the competitive banking-as-a service space with global payments and banking infrastructure fintech Episode Six as its platform partner, the companies announced Tuesday.

Unifimoney, a San Francisco-based multi-asset digital wealth management platform, is the first customer to go live with the new BaaS solution, the companies said in a statement.

The new offering includes real-time payments and card issuing and processing services geared toward the embedded finance market.

The solution also offers anti-money laundering, identity verification and fraud detection services through integrations with application programming interfaces like Astra Finance, an instant payments platform; Sardine, a fraud protection platform; and Prove, an identity verification and authentication platform, according to the statement.

“Open banking is as much if not more of an opportunity for community banks than a threat,” said John Symcox, chief innovation officer at First Fidelity Bank, said in a statement. “It allows us to bring best-in-market solutions to clients and customers at high speed and low cost. The future of money is, we believe, going to be banking plus other services offered as a bundle. We want to be a part of enabling this and core to this ecosystem of new money services.”

The family-owned bank and Episode Six will generate revenue through transaction fees and interest, Symcox said in a separate statement to Banking Dive.

With the growing number of bank and fintech partnerships, the Treasury Department called for more oversight of the fintech sector in November. The department said nonbanks, particularly fintechs, are rebundling core banking services outside the bank regulatory boundary and creating competition in the banking industry.

While speaking about regulators increasing their scrutiny of bank and fintech partnerships, Symcox noted “innovation always outpaces regulation,” so the bank and Episode Six must be prepared for it.

First Fidelity plans to add three to five more BaaS or payments-as-a-service customers in the near future, Symcox said.

“First Fidelity Bank is a Community Bank that sees technology as a competitive advantage, providing our clients with innovative solutions,” CEO Lee Symcox said.

Typically, traditional payments are initiated and settled on specific mechanisms like ACH or wires, but the new BaaS solution is working on ways to provide multiple payment mechanisms, John Symcox said.

“E6 tech is hyper configurable thus allowing our clients to personalize their solutions in a compliant manner,” Episode Six co-founder and CEO John Mitchell told Banking Dive in a statement.

First Fidelity conducts due diligence for business entities before starting any relationship, while the customer due diligence can be performed by either the business customer or First Fidelity, depending on the relationship setup, John Symcox said.

“There are many BaaS solutions in the market now,” Ben Soppitt, CEO of Unifimoney, said in a statement. “They promise the world, but actually launching can be painful, slow and expensive. FFB and E6 have solved this with a platform and process built for the future, not the past. And they’ve done it in a way that makes launching a BaaS solution much easier, allowing us to get to market quickly.”"
U.S. crypto firms seek Swiss banking partners amid banking meltdown,"{'href': 'https://www.reuters.com', 'title': 'Reuters'}","Mon, 13 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvdXMtY3J5cHRvLWZpcm1zLXNlZWstc3dpc3MtYmFua2luZy1wYXJ0bmVycy1hbWlkLWJhbmtpbmctbWVsdGRvd24tMjAyMy0wMy0xMy_SAQA?oc=5,"Representations of cryptocurrencies are seen in this illustration, August 10, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Acquire Licensing Rights

LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - U.S.-based crypto firms are trying to open Swiss bank accounts after the collapse of two U.S. crypto-focused banks made it harder for them to use lenders in the United States, but bankers said the Swiss firms may not take them.

Crypto-focused U.S. bank Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N) said it planned to close last week after it was hit with losses following the dramatic collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November last year.

Its closure was followed by the collapse on Sunday of Signature Bank (SBNY.O) -- seen as U.S. crypto firms' main alternative to Silvergate -- in one of the largest failures in U.S. banking history.

The global banking sector was thrown into turmoil by Friday's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which sent global bank stocks plunging on Monday on concern about further contagion. The tech-focused lender also banked crypto companies and was the second-biggest U.S. bank failure.

Crypto analysts said that the U.S. bank closures, along with a regulatory crackdown in the U.S., would push firms to seek banking partnerships in Europe, Asia, and ""offshore"".

""U.S. regulators have issued multiple warnings to banks about potential risks of working with crypto companies. They haven’t banned it explicitly but made it clear this would be frowned upon,"" said Ivan Kachkovski, crypto and FX analyst at UBS.

""This is likely to push crypto companies to other jurisdictions in search of non-U.S. banks willing to work with the industry.""

Switzerland, long famous for its private banking sector, has also been one of the more welcoming countries in Europe for crypto firms, with the Swiss city of Zug dubbed ""The Crypto Valley.""

Yves Longchamp, managing director of crypto-focused SEBA Bank in Switzerland said there had been a ""pronounced uptick"" in traffic to the bank's website from the U.S., and that in a global call on Friday representatives from the Singapore, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, and Switzerland offices all said they'd seen increased interest from prospective clients.

""Crypto firms and other money managers have already started the onboarding process and many calls are scheduled next weeks,"" he said via email.

Switzerland-based Arab Bank said it saw an increase in U.S. firms, mostly crypto funds or involved in crypto venture capital, seeking to open accounts in the last few weeks as doubts about Silvergate grew. Rani Jabban, head of treasury and financial institutions at Arab Bank, said around 80% of them had been Silvergate customers.

""We had 10-20 enquiries so far… but that doesn't mean that we can cater and open accounts for all of them,"" he said, citing regulatory difficulties of onboarding U.S.-based clients and estimating that only one or two of them would ultimately become Arab Bank customers.

Crypto firms relied on Silvergate's crypto payments network, the Silvergate Exchange Network, which allowed round-the-clock transfers between investors and crypto exchanges, unlike traditional bank wires, which can often take days to settle.

""I don't see any banks also offering the structure that Signature and Silvergate were offering with their internal blockchain 24/7 settlement,"" Arab Bank's Rani said.

Swiss bank Sygnum, which describes itself on its website as ""the world's first digital asset bank"", is sticking to its policy not to take on U.S. clients ""due to a lack of regulatory clarity"" Sygnum's chief marketing officer Dominic Castley told Reuters via email.

"As banking jitterbug dies down, Fed returns to its main dance partner","{'href': 'https://www.reuters.com', 'title': 'Reuters'}","Sun, 02 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvcmF0ZXMtYm9uZHMvYmFua2luZy1qaXR0ZXJidWctZGllcy1kb3duLWZlZC1yZXR1cm5zLWl0cy1tYWluLWRhbmNlLXBhcnRuZXItMjAyMy0wNC0wMy_SAQA?oc=5,"WASHINGTON, April 3 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials, increasingly confident they have nipped a potential financial crisis in the bud, now face a difficult judgment on whether demand in the U.S. economy is falling and, if so, whether it is coming down fast enough to lower inflation.

If the U.S. central bank's policy meeting two weeks ago was dominated by concern that a pair of bank failures risked broader financial contagion - a potential reason to pause further interest rate increases - debate has quickly refocused on whether tighter monetary policy has started to show its impact on the broader economy, or if rates need to rise higher still.

The decision will be a critical one as the Fed plans the final steps in what has been a historic rate hiking cycle, with policymakers still hoping to avoid the sort of deep economic downturn triggered by raising rates too far, but also determined not to do too little and allow inflation to remain high.

The nine rate hikes delivered by the central bank since March of 2022 have pushed the benchmark overnight interest rate from the near-zero level to the current 4.75%-5.00% range, a tightening pace not seen since Paul Volcker was Fed chair in the 1980s. Consumer and business interest rates have followed suit.

Yet data released on Friday showed the Fed's preferred measure of inflation was still running at 5% annually, more than double the 2% target, and projections issued by Fed policymakers on March 22 indicated rates needed to rise a bit more. Also embedded in those projections is the sort of rise in the unemployment rate, from the current 3.8% to 4.6% by the end of the year, and growth slowdown typically associated with recession, something Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues still maintain they can avoid.

""It is absolutely a balance ... There are uncertainties,"" Boston Fed President Susan Collins said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday. ""We do need to balance the risk that we don't do enough ... don't hold the course, and don't bring inflation down ... At the same time I do monitor the data, looking at when we might see the economy turning. ... It is early days yet.""

Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin struck a similar note last week. ""Inflation is still very high. The job market is still very tight,"" he told reporters. ""When you raise rates there's always the risk of the economy softening faster than it might have otherwise. If you don't raise rates, there's the risk of inflation getting out of control.""

That back-and-forth will play out between now and the Fed's next policy meeting on May 2-3, when officials will decide whether to press ahead with another quarter-of-a-percentage-point rate increase and signal if even more hikes are to come, or defer to early evidence that consumers are finally feeling the pinch of tighter credit and higher borrowing costs.

CREDIT CONCERNS

On an inflation-adjusted basis, consumer spending dipped in February, while more recent weekly data on credit card spending from retail banking giants like Citi and Bank of America pointed to a consumer pullback. Consumer sentiment has also edged lower, a possible precursor to retrenchment.

The Labor Department's release this coming Friday of the March employment report will be an important snapshot for the Fed of whether a red-hot job market is cooling - something that would also cause demand to slow.

Investors currently regard the Fed's rate decision next month as a toss-up, the first time that has been the case since the current tightening cycle began in March of 2022.

Concerns remain about the banking sector and the condition of credit markets.

At the last Fed meeting, Powell noted that even if further bank failures are avoided, lending institutions may still become more cautious and, by curbing access to credit, slow the economy faster than anticipated. That is partly how monetary policy is supposed to operate, but if the process goes too far or too fast it could boost the risk of a recession, something Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari has warned about.

Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics

The possibility of an acute crisis, however, seems to have receded. Fed emergency lending to banks, which jumped in the week after the March 10 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and failure of Signature Bank two days later, declined last week in a sign that financial sector stress was easing.

Overall credit provided by banks fell slightly in the week ending March 22 to a seasonally adjusted level of $17.53 trillion from $17.6 trillion the week before. Overall bank deposits fell, but rose slightly at the smaller institutions where recent financial stress has been focused.

Even if credit slows or dips, that may not translate clearly into less spending - and lower inflation - as long as the job market remains as strong as it is.

""People will continue to spend as long as they get paid,"" said Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior U.S. economist with BNP Paribas. ""They get a little bit less access to credit, is it going to really affect the decisions? It will, but only at the point at which they stop getting paid"" because of a slowing economy and rising unemployment.

'MARKED CHANGE'

But regardless of how much or little an upcoming ""credit crunch"" affects the economy, there are signs consumer behavior is already starting to turn.

The personal savings rate, for example, has risen steadily from 3% - a pandemic-era low and well below the level of recent years - to 4.6%, a textbook reaction to the higher yields savers can now earn on money market funds and other short-term cash accounts, with less disposable income left for spending.

Recent spending and savings data show ""a marked change in consumer behaviors ... with inflation prompting more caution,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, wrote after the release last week of the most recent personal consumption statistics.

Reuters Graphics

A recent decline in consumer sentiment was coupled with a drop in inflation expectations, something that could give the Fed confidence to be more cautious with any further rate increases, allowing its inflation fight to spool out over a longer time but with less risk of a full-on recession.

Karen Dynan, a Harvard University economics professor and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said her outlook was for the Fed to face a ""slog"" against inflation that will require more rate increases but, because of the strength of household balance sheets and the labor market, skirt a recession.

Recent bank stress ""has done a bit of the Fed's work for it, but I don't view it as a full substitute,"" she said.

Ultimately, the labor market will have to give way at least somewhat, lowering demand and pushing the U.S. economy's output far enough below its potential for prices to fall.

""I don't think increasing 'slack' is the whole story,"" Dynan said, with things like improved supply and falling rents helping lower the pace of price increases, but ""some cooling of consumer and labor demand will be needed.""

Calling BS Of Bank Fintech Partnership,"{'href': 'https://www.finextra.com', 'title': 'Finextra'}","Wed, 19 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmV4dHJhLmNvbS9ibG9ncG9zdGluZy8yNDU3OS9jYWxsaW5nLWJzLW9mLWJhbmstZmludGVjaC1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcNIBAA?oc=5,"Fintech came into existence with the charter of disrupting traditional banks. It sought to achieve its mission by democratizing finance with modern technologies and superior customer experiences. The plan was to unbundle banking into multiple products, be a CHILL entrant in each product, bring the unbanked and underbanked into its fold first, then work its way upwards to poach mainstream banking customers, and thereby inflict ""death by a thousand cuts"" on banks. What was left unsaid, but very much practised, was to leverage regulatory gaps in doing all of the above nice things.

==========

Google followed this strategy with its now-defunct Google Plex bank account. You can read more about it in my blog post titled RIP Google Plex.

Fintech has flopped in its mission. Far from being killed by fintechs, the banking industry has grown by leaps and bounds and continued to be the most profitable sector in FORTUNE GLOBAL 500. In the last decade 2012-2022, the industry made more than a trillion dollars in profits.

I doubt if the entire fintech industry even got that many pageviews for its websites and apps, let alone revenue or profit.

It's hard to say whether

banks matched the modern technologies and superior CX of fintechs

OR

banking customers didn't care as much for modern technologies and superior CX as fintechs had anticipated.

But one thing is clear: Fintech cannot disrupt banks.

When that piece of reality dawned on the industry, fintech changed its tune to partnering with banks over technology. A bunch of finsurgents emerged, with advice to fintechs on how to go about doing that. Cf. Finextra article in 2016 entitled Advice to Fintech Firms: How to Partner with Banks.

Having been a supplier of technology to banks for two decades, I was very skeptical about fintech's partnership mantra. In deluding themselves into thinking that they invented the bank-partnership concept, fintechs missed a few basic facts of business:

Banks have successfully partnered with the Accentures, IBMs and TCSs of the world (who I call ""fincumbents"") for 40-50 years. It has been a complementary relationship, with both parties crystal clear about their respective roles and responsibilities: Most banking products work on top of technology, banks can't / won't build core banking software, credit card management systems, and other technologies, instead they will buy them from fincumbents, who, on the other hand, will not offer checking account, debit card, credit card and other products to compete with banks. Banks are not fools. They will see through fintechs' partnership ruse as a self-preservation tactic. Nobody likes to partner with someone who publicly threatened to kill them until recently, and still probably continues to do so in private.

In short, banks need technology, they're getting it from fincumbents, and fintechs are the last people with whom they will partner.

It's not only me. The very title of Ron Shevlin's article in The Financial Brand says it all: The Foolish Fantasies of Fintech / Bank Partnerships.

Sure enough, the partnership mantra has not worked too well.

Not wanting to fob off fintechs totally, banks are telling them to line up in front of their procurement department to get themselves enrolled as a potential technology supplier, as they've told all technology companies for the past 40-50 years.

Anyone who has been there and done it knows that it's a long and cumbersome process.

A new bunch of finsurgents has cropped up now, advising fintechs to invest in SOC2, GDPR and other regulations in order to get empanelled by banks. See Finextra article last week titled How Fintechs can Partner with Banks - Challenges and Opportunities for some pearls of wisdom along these lines.

In my opinion, fintechs should ignore this advice. It's their first rodeo with bank partnership. They're naive to think that they dislodge fincumbents who have been around the proverbial Wall Street and Canary Wharf blocks for decades by just getting a few certifications. No point throwing good money after bad.

Going by the Evening Standard article entitled UK Fintech investment drops by more than a third, it seems like fintech investors have come to the same conclusion.

Lacking any significant success on its own and absent any path to revenue and profit by partnering with banks, the fintech industry seems to have reached a dead end amidst the current funding winter.

Not surprisingly, half of fintechs surveyed recently have flagged the risk of shutting down by the end of 2023."

LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Crypto firms have been left scrambling to find banking partners after the collapse of three crypto-friendly lenders in the U.S. last month, creating a risk their business will become concentrated in smaller financial institutions.

It is a scenario that concerns U.S. regulators, who have expressed doubt about the safety and soundness of bank business models that are highly focused on crypto clients after Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N), Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank imploded.

U.S. regulators have also told banks to be alert for liquidity risks coming from crypto-related deposits, which could be subject to rapid outflows if customers try to redeem their crypto assets for real money.

Mainstream banks have become increasingly wary of crypto clients following a series of high-profile collapses, including the bankruptcy of major exchange FTX in November last year, and a lack of regulation.

""Crypto and Web3 start-ups are telling us they simply cannot get a business bank account,"" said Marcus Foster, head of crypto policy at Coadec, a body representing UK start-ups. Foster said the issue has become ""significantly worse"" recently.

This has left digital asset companies with little choice but to seek out smaller financial institutions, some in remoter corners of global finance.

A spokesperson for FV Bank, a U.S.-licensed fintech-focused bank in Puerto Rico, said that it has seen an uptick in inquiries from potential customers in recent weeks, even though it is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The bank does not lend and is therefore not subject to the same type of risks as traditional banks that operate on a fractional reserve system, a spokesperson said.

In Liechtenstein, a spokesperson for Bank Frick said it has also experienced a ""significant increase in account opening requests,"" with the largest portion of inquiries coming from firms in Europe, Singapore and Australia.

However, the bank is not purely focused on crypto and has a broadly diversified business model, the spokesperson said.

Switzerland-based Arab Bank told Reuters in March it had seen an increase in U.S. firms, mostly crypto funds or those involved in crypto venture capital, seeking to open accounts, but that the bank was unlikely to accommodate all of them.

While ZA Bank in Hong Kong, a digital bank, said it had seen about four times more enquiries from crypto firms seeking accounts after Silicon Valley Bank's collapse, although it said it would only accept firms licensed to trade virtual assets.

Nikki Johnstone, a partner at the Allen and Overy law firm in London, said that the ""concentration risk"" that comes from a growing number of clients seeking business from the smaller firms is the ""biggest challenge"" of having reduced crypto banking options.

""That places a greater degree of expectation on that firm to apply the right level of risk management and monitoring,"" she said.

Cryptocurrency companies need access to banks to hold customers' dollar deposits and for day-to-day business activities.

""Of course the motto of crypto is 'we are going to replace the banks', but first of all, we are not there yet, and I don’t think we will be there ever,"" said Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer of Tether, the largest stablecoin by market capitalisation, whose reserves have previously been the subject of investor scrutiny.

'TOP TIER'

Several top banks told Reuters that they are currently turning most potential crypto-related customers away, while others said they are only working with top-tier firms - policies that most say are unchanged from their historical positions.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) is not onboarding any clients that are primarily crypto businesses anywhere in the world, according to a source familiar with the situation, with the exception of a select few firms including Coinbase (COIN.O), which has disclosed that it deposits customer funds at the bank.

The person said this policy has long been its stance.

A source familiar with the Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) said that while the bank examines any crypto company that seeks to become a customer, it is ""very, very rigid"" in its vetting process and has only taken on clients on a case-by-case basis. Circle, the principal issuer of USD Coin, custodies a portion of its reserves with BNY Mellon.

A spokesperson for ING said the bank does not ""target or focus actively on crypto firms"" so its exposure is ""very limited.""

Allen and Overy lawyer Johnstone said that banks are often cautious due to the heightened money-laundering risk in the crypto sector and a lack of robust crypto regulation.

To be sure, some of the largest cryptocurrency companies have ongoing relationships with U.S. banks. Circle, the principal issuer of USD Coin, custodies a portion of its reserves with Customers Bank, and Gemini says it custodies the reserves for its stablecoin at State Street Bank and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) . Coinbase has disclosed that it deposits customer funds at Cross River Bank in addition to JPMorgan Chase.

But for smaller crypto start-ups, securing a banking partner could be more difficult, said Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO of Banxa (BNXA.V), a payment and compliance infrastructure provider for crypto.

""There’s certainly a concern about a lack of banking partners available in the market now, notably for the smaller and less-proven ventures,"" he said.

(This April 19 story has been corrected to fix the name of Banxa U.S. CEO to Richard Mico, not Ricardo Mico, in paragraph 24)

Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg:



Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system. This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth.



After receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and consulting with the President, Secretary Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, in a manner that fully protects all depositors. Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer.



We are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank, New York, New York, which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.



Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. Senior management has also been removed. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law.



Finally, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors.



The U.S. banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry. Those reforms combined with today’s actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors’ savings remain safe.

WASHINGTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The World Bank on Wednesday said it was ""alarmed"" by efforts to overthrow the democratically elected government in Niger, and had suspended disbursements in the African country until further notice, except for private-sector partnerships.

Niger has one of the largest World Bank portfolios in Africa, amounting to $4.5 billion covering the country’s priority sectors, and it has also received $600 million in direct budget support from the bank between 2022 and 2023.

""The World Bank believes that peace, stability, and rule of law are fundamental for creating a world free of poverty on a livable planet. We are alarmed by efforts to overthrow the democratically elected government in Niger,"" it said in a statement.

""As a result, the World Bank has paused disbursements for all operations until further notice other than private sector partnerships which will continue with caution."" The World Bank said it would continue monitoring the situation.

""We are driven by the ambition to improve the quality of life and opportunities for the people of Niger,"" it added.

Niger's regional and international partners are scrambling to respond to a military coup that political analysts say could have grave consequences for democratic progress and the fight against an insurgency by jihadist militants in West Africa.

A military junta overthrew Niger's democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum and his government on July 26 in the seventh military takeover in less than three years in West and Central Africa.

West African regional bloc ECOWAS sent a delegation to Niger on Wednesday to negotiate with the military officers who seized power, hoping to find a diplomatic solution before they have to decide whether to intervene.

The Bank’s private sector arm, IFC, has mobilized close to $50 million of investments in Niger in the last three years with projects worth $75 million under consideration for this year.

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the World Bank's political risk arm, has supported one project in Niger's financial technology sector valued at $2.25 million, and has been developing a pipeline of projects in the renewable energy and telecom sectors.

"IRS, Security Summit partners warn taxpayers of new scam; unusual delivery service mailing tries to trick people into sending photos, bank account information","{'href': 'https://www.irs.gov', 'title': 'IRS'}","Mon, 03 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcnMuZ292L25ld3Nyb29tL2lycy1zZWN1cml0eS1zdW1taXQtcGFydG5lcnMtd2Fybi10YXhwYXllcnMtb2YtbmV3LXNjYW0tdW51c3VhbC1kZWxpdmVyeS1zZXJ2aWNlLW1haWxpbmctdHJpZXMtdG8tdHJpY2stcGVvcGxlLWludG8tc2VuZGluZy1waG90b3MtYmFuay1hY2NvdW50LWluZm9ybWF0aW9u0gEA?oc=5,"IR-2023-123, July 3, 2023

WASHINGTON ― The Internal Revenue Service warned taxpayers today to be on the lookout for a new scam mailing that tries to mislead people into believing they are owed a refund.

The new scheme involves a mailing coming in a cardboard envelope from a delivery service. The enclosed letter includes the IRS masthead and wording that the notice is ""in relation to your unclaimed refund.""

Like many scams, the letter includes contact information and a phone number that do not belong to the IRS. But it also seeks a variety of sensitive personal information from taxpayers – including detailed pictures of driver's licenses – that can be used by identity thieves to try obtaining a tax refund and other sensitive financial information.

""This is just the latest in the long string of attempts by identity thieves posing as the IRS in hopes of tricking people into providing valuable personal information to steal identities and money, including tax refunds,"" said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. ""These scams can come in through email, text or even in special mailings. People should be careful to watch out for red flags that clearly mark these as IRS scams.""

The Security Summit – a coalition between the IRS, state tax administrators and the nation's tax industry – continue to warn people to protect their personal information to protect against tax-related identity theft as well as scams like this.

In this new scam, there are many warning signs that can be seen in many similar schemes via email or by text. An unusual feature of this scam is that it tries tricking people to email or phone very detailed personal information in hopes of stealing valuable information.

The letter tells the recipients they need to provide ""Filing Information"" for their refund. This includes some awkwardly worded requests like this:

""A Clear Phone of Your Driver's License That Clearly Displays All Four (4) Angles, Taken in a Place with Good Lighting.""

The letter proceeds for more sensitive information including cellphone number, bank routing information, Social Security number and bank account type, followed by a poorly worded warning:

""You'll Need to Get This to Get Your Refunds After Filing. These Must Be Given to a Filing Agent Who Will Help You Submit Your Unclaimed Property Claim. Once You Send All The Information Please Try to Be Checking Your Email for Response From The Agents Thanks""

This letter contains a variety of warning signs, including odd punctuation and a mixture of fonts as well as inaccuracies.

For example, the letter says the deadline for filing tax refunds is Oct. 17; the deadline for people on extension for their 2022 tax returns is actually Oct.16, and those owed refunds from last year have time beyond that. And the IRS handles tax refunds, not ""unclaimed property.""

Important reminders about scams

The IRS and Security Summit partners regularly warn people about common scams, including the annual IRS Dirty Dozen list.

Taxpayers and tax professionals should be alert to fake communications posing as legitimate organizations in the tax and financial community, including the IRS and states. These messages can arrive in the form of an unsolicited text or email to lure unsuspecting victims to provide valuable personal and financial information that can lead to identity theft, including phishing and smishing.

The IRS never initiates contact with taxpayers by email, text or social media regarding a bill or tax refund.

As a reminder: Never click on any unsolicited communication claiming to be the IRS as it may surreptitiously load malware. It may also be a way for malicious hackers to load ransomware that keeps the legitimate user from accessing their system and files.

Individuals should never respond to tax-related phishing or smishing or click on the URL link. Instead, the scams should be reported by sending the email or a copy of the text/SMS as an attachment to phishing@irs.gov. The report should include the caller ID (email or phone number), date, time and time zone, and the number that received the message.

Taxpayers can also report scams to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration or the Internet Crime Complaint Center. The Report Phishing and Online Scams page at IRS.gov provides complete details. The Federal Communications Commission's Smartphone Security Checker is a useful tool against mobile security threats.

The IRS also warns taxpayers to be wary of messages that appear to be from friends or family but that are possibly stolen or compromised email or text accounts from someone they know. This remains a popular way to target individuals and tax preparers for a variety of scams. Individuals should verify the identity of the sender by using another communication method; for instance, calling a number they independently know to be accurate, not the number provided in the email or text."

Financial System Review—2023,"{'href': 'https://www.bankofcanada.ca', 'title': 'Bank of Canada'}","Tue, 16 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtvZmNhbmFkYS5jYS8yMDIzLzA1L2ZpbmFuY2lhbC1zeXN0ZW0tcmV2aWV3LTIwMjMv0gEA?oc=5,"Overview

Over the past year, financial conditions have tightened globally in response to monetary policy actions aimed at reducing inflation. Recent stresses in the banking sector in the United States and Switzerland further tightened financial conditions. Authorities in these countries reacted swiftly, limiting the spillover effects to the broader financial system.

These events have exposed vulnerabilities—notably, business models that rely excessively on an environment of low interest rates and low volatility—and serve as a reminder that risks can emerge and spread quickly. As the financial sector adjusts to higher interest rates, participants, regulators and central banks must be more vigilant about vulnerabilities and risks.

Canadian regulators have taken important steps to help safeguard the financial system. Canadian banks remain robust, but they are not immune to international developments. The reliance of Canada’s large banks on wholesale funding makes them vulnerable to deteriorating conditions in global financial markets. If the cost of wholesale funding were to rise significantly due to a persistent period of global financial stress, it could lead to Canadian banks tightening lending conditions, making it more difficult and expensive for Canadian households and businesses to access credit.

In light of higher borrowing costs, the Bank of Canada is more concerned than it was last year about the ability of households to service their debt. More households are expected to face financial pressure in the coming years as their mortgages are renewed. The decline in house prices has also reduced homeowner equity, and some signs of financial stress—particularly among recent homebuyers—are beginning to appear.

A large negative shock, such as a severe global recession with significant unemployment that further depresses house prices, could increase loan defaults among households. If defaults on uninsured mortgages with negative equity were to occur on a large scale, they could result in sizable credit losses for Canadian lenders.

Elevated funding costs and persistent periods of stress can reduce the capacity of the banking sector to provide market liquidity. This liquidity is crucial to financial stability given the growing importance of non-bank financial intermediaries, such as asset managers, and their reliance on fixed-income liquidity. If a significant spike in demand for liquidity were to occur, it could lead to a potentially destabilizing decline in asset prices.

The Bank remains concerned about threats to financial stability from a major cyber incident, particularly in the context of rising geopolitical tensions and Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. A successful cyber attack that damages activities in one part of the financial system could spread quickly, undermining the public’s confidence.

Climate change also poses significant risks. These risks include disruptions from more frequent and extreme weather events and uncertainty about the transition to a low-carbon economy. The measurement of these risks remains inconsistent globally, and their disclosure, insufficient. For these reasons, assets exposed to these risks may be mispriced. An abrupt repricing of these assets could lead to losses for financial system participants.

Cryptoasset markets do not currently represent a significant concern for the stability of the Canadian financial system. They remain small and mostly separate from the financial system. If they do become more interconnected, shocks in these markets could spread to the broader financial system and affect financial stability.

The Bank will continue to closely monitor the financial system for early signs of strain and has the tools to provide emergency liquidity to the financial system if severe stress were to develop."
Analysis: Banking turmoil takes the leveraged out of the buyout,"{'href': 'https://www.reuters.com', 'title': 'Reuters'}","Thu, 23 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZGVhbHMvYmFua2luZy10dXJtb2lsLXRha2VzLWxldmVyYWdlZC1vdXQtYnV5b3V0LTIwMjMtMDMtMjMv0gEA?oc=5,"Signage is seen outside the Blackstone Group headquarters in New York City, U.S., January 18, 2023.

March 23 (Reuters) - Private equity firms that acquired companies since the banking crisis started on March 8 have funded the deals mostly with their own funds, a departure from traditional leveraged buyouts that reflects their struggle to secure cheap debt.

Four acquisitions of companies by private equity firms that were announced in the last two weeks were funded by debt that accounted for between 9% and 50% of the deal consideration, according to a Reuters review of regulatory filings. The remainder was equity checks by the private equity firms.

Typically, debt accounts for between 60% and 80% of the deal consideration, allowing the buyout firms to juice returns.

Private equity executives and their advisers say the shift towards more equity financing started before the turmoil in the banking sector this month, as the rise in interest rates over the course of the last year made debt more expensive, and fears about an economic slowdown made lenders more risk-averse.

Yet this trend picked up steam after three U.S. banks collapsed this month and concerns over the banking sector's resilience forced many lenders to retrench, they added.

""Private equity investors are having to pick their spots and need to have very strong conviction to be able to get a deal done,"" said Rob Pulford, partner and head of the financial and strategic investors group at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).

When Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N) clinched the $4.6 billion acquisition of U.S. cloud-based event-software provider Cvent Holding Corp (CVT.O) from Vista Equity Partners on March 14, it only borrowed $1 billion for the deal. The rest came from Blackstone, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and Vista, which rolled over a portion of its stake in Cvent.

In similar fashion, Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board agreed on March 12 to buy data analytics firm Qualtrics International Inc (XM.O) for $12.5 billion by using only $1 billion in debt.

Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) signed an $8.1 billion agreement to acquire specialty chemicals distributor Univar Solutions Inc (UNVR.N) on March 14 by using debt for only half the deal consideration.

Symphony Technology Group agreed on March 13 to acquire Momentive Global Inc (MNTV.O), the owner of online survey vendor SurveyMonkey, for $1.5 billion while using only $450 million in debt.

Six private equity firms polled by Reuters said they had not adjusted down their typical 20% annualized return expectations in light of the tough debt financing environment. They requested anonymity because such figures are kept confidential between the firms and their investors.

Bob Rivollier, a private equity partner at law firm Ropes & Gray, said that many buyout firms that rely heavily on equity financing believe it's possible to achieve the returns they have seen in the past by adding debt to the companies they buy down the road. This has made return assumptions on these deals more precarious, he added.

""Equity isn't cheap. Between a deal where 40 percent is equity and 60 percent is debt and one where 100 percent is equity, you're going to need a much higher return for the equity deal to get the same overall return to your investors,"" Rivollier said.

REFINANCING RISK

To be sure, a handful of private equity firms have already been accustomed to this kind of refinancing risk. Vista and Thoma Bravo are among the private equity firms that in the last 12 months have been buying companies with mostly equity financing with plans to add debt to them later. They do this to avoid lengthy negotiations with lenders while they hurry to clinch deals with sellers.

An upside to the shift toward equity financing, dealmakers say, is that the companies owned by the private equity firms have more cushion to absorb losses if their business deteriorates. Many of the leveraged buyouts that became bankruptcies in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis were the result of private equity firms saddling companies with debt to the hilt.

Jonathan Rouner, vice chairman of investment banking at Nomura Securities, said private equity firms reserved the option when to add more debt to their companies when it's possible and safe to do so.

""You fund the investment with equity and, when financing markets recover, do a large financing to take your equity back out,"" Rouner said.

"World Bank Group Intensifies Focus on Private Sector, Launches Effort to Scale Investment in Emerging Markets","{'href': 'https://www.worldbank.org', 'title': 'World Bank Group'}","Thu, 22 Jun 2023 14:22:24 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3JsZGJhbmsub3JnL2VuL25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS8yMDIzLzA2LzIyL3dvcmxkLWJhbmstZ3JvdXAtaW50ZW5zaWZpZXMtZm9jdXMtb24tcHJpdmF0ZS1zZWN0b3ItbGF1bmNoZXMtZWZmb3J0LXRvLXNjYWxlLWludmVzdG1lbnQtaW4tZW1lcmdpbmctbWFya2V0c9IBAA?oc=5,"PARIS, June 22, 2023—The World Bank Group today launched the Private Sector Investment Lab, a concrete step in a broader effort to develop, and rapidly scale, solutions that address the barriers preventing private sector investment in emerging markets.

Trillions of dollars of investment are required annually in emerging markets and developing countries to make adequate progress towards climate goals, to manage the risks of climate change, and to tackle poverty. The scale of this challenge requires the private sector to play a significant role alongside the World Bank Group and other development institutions.

The World Bank Group is approaching this work with urgency and purpose bringing to bear its leadership capacity, knowledge, and resources to pursue tangible results. The Lab’s work will include an emphasis on scaling transition finance, with an initial sectoral focus on renewable energy and energy infrastructure. It will build on the World Bank’s current work to address existing barriers and ensure a bias towards ideas that can be implemented quickly.

The core group will be charged with utilizing new approaches and recommendations that support the World Bank’s capital mobilization at the scale needed. This includes ideas for improved financing structures, ways to better align the World Bank Group with the needs and speed of private finance mobilization, approaches to balancing and allocating risks across investors, and new partnerships, as well as other areas where there is an opportunity to better catalyze private investment.

Ajay Banga, World Bank Group President announced the new initiative at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, alongside the Lab’s two co-chairs – Mark Carney and Shriti Vadera.

Mark Carney is currently UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance and co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). In addition to his roles at the UN and GFANZ, Carney is the former Governor of both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, and serves as Chair and Head of Transition Investing at Brookfield Asset Management, a global alternative asset manager. Shriti Vadera is currently the chair of Prudential plc, an Asian and African focused insurance company and asset manager. Prior to that, she chaired Santander UK and has worked at the intersection of business, finance, development, and public policy for almost forty years, including as a Minister in the UK government.

The Lab will be comprised of senior leaders from private finance and business who have experience financing, investing, and doing business in emerging markets and developing economies. That team will be announced in the coming weeks. They will work closely with experts from government, regulatory policy, and civil society – across regions and sectors.

The Lab will meet regularly and will report directly to the World Bank Group President Ajay Banga and World Bank Group leadership including Axel van Trotsenburg, Hiroshi Matano, Anna Bjerde, and Anshula Kant. Makhtar Diop, Managing Director of the International Finance Corporation will oversee coordination and serve as a day-to-day point of contact into the World Bank Group.

Ajay Banga, World Bank Group President: “For years, the World Bank Group, governments, and other multilateral institutions have tried – and fallen short – to mobilize meaningful private investment in emerging markets. Given the urgency and scale of our intertwined challenges, we must try a new approach – and the World Bank Group has a central role to play in this effort by using its resources, convening power, and knowledge to catalyze private capital more effectively.”

Mark Carney, UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance and co-chair of GFANZ: “Investment in emerging markets and developing economies must scale fourfold. Business as Usual will not work. Public institutions can and must do more to mobilize private finance, and private finance must work with development partners to create blended finance vehicles that can be rapidly scaled. I therefore welcome Ajay’s leadership in establishing the World Bank’s Private Sector Investment Lab to bring together private finance, MDBs, and development finance institutions. And I look forward to working with him and Shriti Vadera to help deliver this vital component of the transition finance the planet needs and its people deserve.”

Shriti Vadera, Chair of Prudential plc: “I am delighted that Ajay Banga is prioritizing how the World Bank can leverage and crowd in private finance that will not otherwise be available for global public goods like climate transition, growth and poverty reduction, and that he is focused on delivery and implementation, moving beyond promises and pledges to credible execution. And that is why I am so honored to be working with him alongside Mark Carney, and I hope many other colleagues in the public and private sectors to try and have a real impact on the ground.”

Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Rob, for your leadership of the American Bankers Association. I greatly appreciate the invitation to be with all of you at an important moment.

As everyone in this room knows, the American economy relies on a healthy banking system that can provide for the credit needs of families and businesses. American households depend on banks to finance their homes, invest in an education, and otherwise improve their standards of living. Businesses borrow from these institutions to start new companies and expand existing ones.

I. Recent Developments in the Banking System

Almost two weeks ago, we learned of problems at two banks that could have had significant impacts on the broader banking system and the economy. The situation demanded a swift response. In the days that followed, the federal government delivered just that: decisive and forceful actions to strengthen public confidence in the U.S. banking system and protect the American economy.

Let me be clear: the government’s recent actions have demonstrated our resolute commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors’ savings and the banking system remain safe.

Our approach had two main pillars.

First, we worked with the Federal Reserve and FDIC to protect all depositors in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The steps we took were not focused on aiding specific banks or classes of banks. Our intervention was necessary to protect the broader U.S. banking system. And similar actions could be warranted if smaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion. I believe that our actions reduced the risk of further bank failures that would have imposed losses on the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is paid for through fees on insured banks.

Second, we announced a new facility to provide additional liquidity to the banking system. The Fed’s new lending facility – the Bank Term Funding Program – is designed to help banks meet the needs of all of their depositors.

The situation is stabilizing. And the U.S. banking system remains sound. The Fed facility and discount window lending are working as intended to provide liquidity to the banking system. Aggregate deposit outflows from regional banks have stabilized.

As you know, 11 banks – including the very largest and some regional banks – announced $30 billion in deposits into First Republic Bank last week. This support represents a vote of confidence in our banking system.

We are continuing to monitor conditions closely. My team and I have been in close communication with many of you, in addition to federal and state regulators, other market participants, and international counterparts.

While we don’t yet have all the details about the collapse of the two banks, we do know that the recent developments are very different than those of the Global Financial Crisis. Back then, many financial institutions came under stress due to their holdings of subprime assets. We do not see that situation in the banking system today. Our financial system is also significantly stronger than it was 15 years ago. This is in large part due to post-crisis reforms that provided stronger capital standards, among other important improvements.

In the coming weeks, it will be vital for us to get a full accounting of exactly what happened in these bank failures. Regulators have already announced a review into Silicon Valley Bank. We are currently focused on the situation at hand. But we will need to reexamine our current regulatory and supervisory regimes and consider whether they are appropriate for the risks that banks face today. We all share an interest in ensuring that the United States remains the strongest and safest financial system in the world.

II. Importance of a Broad and Diverse Banking System

Given recent developments, I think it is important to reaffirm a broader point: our dynamic and diverse banking system is critical to the American economy. Large banks play an important role in our economy, but so do small- and mid-sized banks. These banks are heavily engaged in traditional banking services that provide vital credit and financial support to families and small businesses. They also increase competition in the banking sector, and often have specialized knowledge and expertise in the communities they invest in.

Indeed, many of these banks have played an important role in supporting our economic recovery. In the depths of the pandemic, Treasury was tasked with getting money quickly and responsibly to those who needed it. So, we worked closely with many of you to send economic impact payments to millions of families. You’ve also worked with us to deliver advance payments from the enhanced Child Tax Credit – which helped cut child poverty nearly in half in 2021. And we’ve collaborated to rapidly deploy assistance to hundreds of thousands of homeowners facing foreclosure.

I also know that many of you are working with state governments to inject new financing into small businesses as part of our State Small Business Credit Initiative. In the prior iteration of this program, lenders with less than $10 billion in assets accounted for 95 percent of all program-supported loans. Our Administration has also been focused on working with mission-oriented banks to put us on a path toward inclusive economic growth. For example, Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program has invested almost $8.4 billion in depository institutions that are CDFIs and MDIs.

Treasury is committed to ensuring the ongoing health and competitiveness of our vibrant community and regional banking institutions.

III. Conclusion

To end, let me return to where I started. A safe and sound banking system is integral to the health of the American economy. We are squarely focused on doing our job. And you should rest assured that we will remain vigilant.

I look forward to continuing to work together to strengthen our banking system and our nation’s economy.

Thank you."
"New Treasury Report Shows Fintech Industry Requires Additional Oversight to Close Gaps, Prevent Abuses and Protect Consumers","{'href': 'https://home.treasury.gov', 'title': 'Treasury'}","Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vaG9tZS50cmVhc3VyeS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9qeTExMDXSAQA?oc=5,"Report Recommends that Fintech-Bank Partnerships be Subject to Enhanced Supervision

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the White House Competition Council, has released a report entitled “Assessing Impacts of New Entrant Non-bank Firms on Competition in Consumer Finance Markets.” The report finds that, while concentration among federally insured banks is growing, new entrant non-bank firms, in particular “fintech” firms, are adding significantly to the number of firms and business models competing in core consumer finance markets and appear to be contributing to competitive pressure. While these fintech firms are enabling new capabilities, they are also creating new risks to consumer protection and market integrity, such as risks related to data privacy and regulatory arbitrage. To protect consumers in these rapidly changing markets and enable sustainable competition, among other recommendations, the report calls for enhanced oversight of the consumer financial activities of non-bank firms.

“Innovation and competition must work hand in hand in a healthy economy,” U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said. “While non-bank firms’ entrance into core consumer finance markets has increased competition and innovation, it has not come without additional risks to consumer protection and market integrity. This report lays out actions that would maintain fair, transparent, and competitive markets while encouraging responsible innovation that benefits consumers. With existing authorities, regulators can encourage competition and innovation while further safeguarding and protecting consumers.”

The report is a product of President Biden’s July 2021 Executive Order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” and is the final in a series of reports assessing competition in various aspects of the economy, including the alcohol industry and the labor market. Today’s report recommends a series of steps to encourage fair and responsible competition that benefits consumers and their financial well-being:

To address market integrity and safety and soundness concerns, regulators should provide a clear and consistently applied supervisory framework for bank-fintech relationships. A bank-fintech relationship that delivers consumer financial services provided by an insured depository institution (IDI) must operate in compliance with the laws, regulations, and risk management standards applicable to the IDI.

To protect consumers, regulators should robustly supervise bank-fintech lending relationships for compliance with consumer protection laws and their impact on consumers’ financial well-being.

To encourage consumer-beneficial innovation, regulators should support innovations in consumer credit underwriting designed to increase credit visibility, reduce bias, and prudently expand credit to underserved consumers.

The future of banks: A $20 trillion breakup opportunity,"{'href': 'https://www.mckinsey.com', 'title': 'McKinsey'}","Tue, 20 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tY2tpbnNleS5jb20vaW5kdXN0cmllcy9maW5hbmNpYWwtc2VydmljZXMvb3VyLWluc2lnaHRzL3RoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtYmFua3MtYS0yMC10cmlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXItYnJlYWt1cC1vcHBvcnR1bml0edIBAA?oc=5,"The banking sector is at a turning point. Key measures for banks are at a historical low point. The sectorâs price-to-book value has fallen to less than one-third the value of other industries. That gap is less the result of current profitability and more about uncertain profit growth in the future. While banks have pushed for great improvements recently, margins are shrinkingâdown more than 25 percent in the past 15 years and expected to fall to 30 percent, another 20 percent decrease, in the next decade.

Regulation and increasing intersectional competition are still worries, but the bigger threat is a global trend: new challengesâoften from different industries and often benefiting from the kind of cross-industry platforms behind the recent success of companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, PayPal, and Spotifyâwith a vastly superior economic model. The market believes that banks are headed in the wrong direction, without a future-proof strategy.

We believe that the skeptics are right about todayâand wrong about tomorrow. Banking is facing a future marked by fundamental restructuring. But we also believe that banks that successfully manage this transition will become bigger and more profitable and grow faster while leading to a value creation opportunity of up to $20 trillion.

In the next era, banks can realign to compete in new arenas, organized around distinct customer needs. These arenas will expand far beyond the current definition of financial services, and they will also be hotly contested by a wide range of tech giants, tech start-ups, and other nonbanks. But this daunting reorganization, or breakup, could also provide banks with a huge opportunity: higher margins, new revenue streams, and loftier valuations. Ambitious banks can break free from stagnant valuations, thrive, and grow if they are willing to embrace the platforms of the future and make a few strategic, informed big bets.

Why break up? First, economic forces and technology have ended the run of the universal-bank model, and investors already are recognizing radical specialization to be greater than the traditional one-stop shop. By contrast, the future model relies on breaking up into four specialized platforms we will describe. Organizing around these areas will be a structural advantage.

In this article, we aim to draw a picture of what the future of banking could look like. We examine the forces currently squeezing bank revenue, value, profits, and usefulness to customers. We identify five distinct areas where banks may well have to transform to thrive.

Of course, we donât know exactly what banks will look like in the future. Regulation, technology, geopolitical shifts, and unforeseen innovations could radically alter the way that the industry develops. But we do believe that the banks that successfully manage the coming transition will use tech and data to embed themselves deeper into customersâ lives with real-time services that were unimaginable just a few short years ago. The opportunity is great for those who move fast into this new future.

Banking is losing its traditional advantages

Until recently, big banks drove profits and growth by applying synergies, economies of scale, and access to huge pools of capital. This massive industry already manages an estimated $370 trillion in worldwide assets, and its growth is accelerating. We project that global assets will grow to between $500 trillion and $550 trillion in the next decade.

While traditional banks have been convenient one-stop shops for businesses and consumers, many havenât evolved their products in a way that matches the tech-driven pace of change in other industries. Products such as checking accounts, loans, and even corporate advisory can seem undifferentiated. And people increasingly feel frustrated by the financial fragmentation that banks have imposed on many consumer processes. For instance, buying a home once required navigating a confusing world of disconnected real-estate brokers, mortgage lenders, insurance companies, lawyers, renovation contractors, and so on. Our grandparents tolerated those frustrations, but they also used pay phones. There were no other options. Today, we are awash in new ways to reach and connect with consumers. Banks need to identify and engage these customersâas their newer competitors are doing.

While traditional banks have been convenient one-stop shops, many havenât evolved their products in a way that matches the tech-driven pace of change in other industries.

To compete, most banks will have to embrace cross-industrial platforms. These new platforms dismantle the barriers between traditional industries, reshaping customer behavior and turning formerly linear value chains into ecosystems that fulfill customer needs in new ways. The process has already reached critical mass in industries such as healthcare, media, music, and retail, where diverse players are connected by platforms created by global leading companies that have been amply rewarded by the global capital markets. In contrast, banks have been consistently undervalued by the capital markets, making banking the lowest-valued sector in the world in 2021.

Because of cross-industrial âplatformization,â banks must now compete with any organization that has the capacity and desire to offer any kind of financial services. Global tech giants such as Google and Tencent have used their platforms to offer banking services seamlessly to their millions of customers. But new competition is booming exponentially around the world.

Tech advances have eliminated size as an advantage in providing excellent services, winning customer loyalty, aggregating and analyzing data, and building networks of capital. Roughly 200 digital banks have launched since 2015, as have new brokerages such as Robinhood, wealth-advisory services such as Betterment, alternate investment banking paths such as special-purpose acquisition companies, payment platforms, and start-up capital platforms such as SeedInvest Technology.

The new competitors have raised the bar on customer expectations. Both individual and organizational customers now seek a long list of attributes from their financial-service providers. Surveys show that these desires include high levels of personalization, zero friction, and a commitment to social and environmental impact. The markets believe that the newcomers can meet their customersâ demands. As of September 2022, there were at least 274 fintech companies with a unicorn valuation of more than $1 billion, up from just 25 in 2017. Collectively, they have a market value of more than $1 trillion.

Many traditional banks, on the other hand, face stagnant or decreased revenue and profits. The average global banking ROE was around 9.5 percent in 2021âa significant recovery from 6 percent in 2020, but a sharp decline from 15 percent prior to the 2008 crisis. By 2030, we project that it will fall below 7.2 percent.

These falling margins are contributing in turn to weaker stock market valuations. Banking stocks trade at an accelerating discount to other industriesâfrom a 15 percent discount in 2000 to a 70 percent discount in 2022. This means that global investors are voting with trillions of dollars against the future profitability and sustainability of the existing business model of universal banks.

Competitive arenas and business models are emerging in banking

The era when all financial services were dominated by monolithic banking entities is over. What, then, will arise to take its place? We believe that the future of banking will be contested by banks and nonbanks in five cross-industry competitive arenas: everyday banking, investment advisory, complex financing, mass wholesale intermediation, and banking as a service (BaaS).

The future of banking will be contested in five cross-industry competitive arenas. In the next decade, revenues for all these arenas could grow by as much as three to 30 times.

While these arenas encompass the products and services provided by banks today, they will be redefined and reinvented by different customer needs. This new competitive landscape has transformative potential. In the next decade, revenues for all these arenas could grow dramatically, by as much as three to 30 times.

In each of the five arenas, we see the potential for at least two platform business models. These ten platforms arenât theoretical models. They are trends that we already see in progress among organizations that are winning better valuations in the capital markets.

Everyday banking

Everyday banking encompasses day-to-day financial services, such as checking and savings accounts, credit cards, personal loans, payment processing, and lines of credit on the traditional-banking side, for individuals and for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). This arena will also include e-commerce ecosystems, loyalty programs, discounts, advertising, and peer-to-peer marketplacesâmaking banking not a chore or obligation but something easy and even enjoyable (see sidebar âA full-fledged e-commerce bank: Kaspiâ). For SMEs, it will include tools to help organizations manage their finances.

A full-fledged e-commerce bank: Kaspi Share Kazakhstanâs KaspiÂ is proof that even in a country far from the centers of global finance, itâs possible to transform everyday banking. It launched an e-commerce marketplace in 2014 and home-delivery service in 2015. Kaspi has captured roughly half of the nationâs online sales in just eight years and has steadily expanded the breadth of its offerings, all tightly integrated. There are four main pillars in its ecosystem: fintech, marketplace, payments, and government services. Kaspiâs customers have access to millions of products from more than 400,000 partnering merchants, ranging from low-price clothing and cosmetics to higher-price electronics, furniture, and jewelry. It enables easy, discounted shopping at retailers. Kaspi charges its partners a 5 to 11 percent fee, and its users pay nothing. For frequent purchases, they get cash bonuses deposited directly into their Kaspi accountsâa strong incentive to make Kaspi their primary bank. Kaspi offers a shopping club, Kaspi Red, whose main component is credit. Financing terms are determined by user activity, including browsing and purchase history. Kaspiâs advantage is leveraging proprietary data collected across its ecosystem and applying sophisticated analytics to them. Some credit decisions can be made within ten seconds of a completed application. Kaspi Pay, its app, enables customers to pay for household needs, make online and in-store purchases, and manage peer-to-peer payments. It bolsters Kaspiâs profit margins by removing the intermediaries that previously handled payments for Kaspi. Through launching its own terminals with QR codes, the app has marginalized payment networks in the country and now has around a 70 percent share in transactions and payments. It offers current account and bill payment, including payments for taxes and public utilities. Its peer-to-peer service has drawn many new customers into the Kaspi ecosystem. The platform is growing fast, with the total volume of payments up 111 percent in 2021. The fintech pillar is the biggest driver of Kaspiâs revenue. It applies AI and big data to reduce Kaspiâs risks on many kinds of loans, including small-business loans and short-term consumer loans for marketplace customers. Within its fintech area, the most widely used service is to buy now and pay later. Kaspiâs fintech portfolio grew 42 percent in 2021, and the related average customer savings rose 34 percent. Kaspi has been especially effective in integrating its different platforms and services via its Super App, which hosts all services. Kaspi has introduced a travel platform for airline tickets, moved into e-grocery, has strong offerings in government services, and is planning to add hotel and vacation packages. Its strategy as a commerce marketplace strategist is paying off, with total 2021 revenue up 46 percent.

The common thread of all these services is that customers want them to be hassle free, reliable, highly automated, and inexpensive in their day-to-day life (see sidebar âA multipronged approach: Royal Bank of Canadaâ). The ultimate goal for everyday banking is invisibilityâoffering services that are cheap and easy and accessible through all channels via business models such as the following:

Commerce marketplace specialist (CMS). Specializing as a commerce marketplace offers everyday banking for individuals and many nonbanking services via a marketplace platform (see sidebar âCommerce marketplace specialist: From WeChat to WeBankâ). It can be a single access point for anything from consumer goods and electronics to home-cleaning services and movie tickets, all connected to bank accounts, or niche solutions embedded into selected specialized journeys. A CMS uses automation and personalization to make everything simpleâonline, offline, and eventually in the metaverse. It will have to compete with the generalist and specialist e-commerce platforms of tomorrow.

Business gateway provider. Serving as a gateway provider offers everyday banking for SMEs via an integrated online portal, aggregating services that facilitate payments, cash flow financing, accounting, taxes, and so on. It allows organizations to focus on their core activities by automating many of the basic activities of running a business.

A multipronged approach: Royal Bank of Canada Share Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Canadaâs largest bank, approached the challenge of everyday banking with an entrepreneurial mindset, building several start-ups and exploring partnerships. RBC is committed to having a presence in multiple ecosystems. The bank introduced the following initiatives, among others: RBC Ventures launched in 2017 as the bankâs semi-independent venture capitalist function to find and finance new projects. It had a start-up-like culture and decision-making process separate from the core RBC business. Within two years, it reached 3.2 million Canadians with various value propositionsâand prompted tens of thou-sands to become new RBC banking clients.

Ownrâan end-to-end small-business gateway focused on start-upsâoffers, for example, web design, business registration, and banking services on one platform.

GarbageDay is a tool to help residents remember their garbage and recyclable collection days, seasonal tasks, and parking information. Roughly 200,000 Canadians now use it.

RBC Rewards became the top program in Canada, with an app providing personalized offers. It operates now as a marketplace, with merchants not only funding rewards but also paying a markup and using the program as part of their distribution strategy.

NOMI, a free, AI-driven personal financial-management tool, launched in 2017 and is now part of the main RBC app. The product has three differentiating factors: NOMI Find & Save learns transaction patterns and automatically sets aside money (up to CAD $50 per day) for use in the future. NOMI Insights summarizes a userâs banking activity, while NOMI Budgets categorizes spending into five categories and compares the userâs current spending with benchmarks.

A business gateway provider will compete with online accounting platforms, software companies, and even telcos for the small-business service ecosystem.

Investment advisory

Investment advisory is the arena to provide investment and insurance products for all kinds of customers, from young people just starting to build wealth to older people who need sophisticated investments and protection to institutions. This includes financial planning, brokerages, trusts, retirement plans, and many kinds of insurance. People crave tailored advice and trust-based relationships that make them feel understood, even when dealing with virtual advisers online.

On the business side, this arena comprises the advisory aspects of investment banking and other financial-advice services. The goal for investment advisory is superb personalizationâblending the human touch with digital efficiency through business models such as the following:

Personal wealth and health guardian. Guarding personal wealth and health means offering investment and personal-protection advice in the broadest sense, including health insurance, virtual care, and life insurance. It features a blend of human experts and highly personalized AI that can guide customers through a broad range of investment and protection options. Imagine a retirement plan, aid in college savings, and protection against surprise medical costsâjust a few of the services a guardian provides.

B2B advisory boutique. Serving as a specialist in B2B advising means offering tailored investment advice for corporate customers, with high-level expertise in specialties such as asset management and debt options.

Commerce marketplace specialist: From WeChat to WeBank Share WeBank, owned by the Chinese technology and social-media conglomerate Tencent, is an example of a commerce marketplace specialist (CMS) that leverages the strengths of big tech, especially network effects. Tencent owns both one of the largest social-media companies and one of the largest video game companies in the world. Its instant-messaging apps WeChat and QQ have about 1.3 billion and 570 million monthly active users, respectively. Tencent is also changing how people access banking through WeBank. WeBankâs strategy is built upon âthe three As.â Its services are easily âaccessibleâ via 24/7 mobile banking. They are âaffordableâ enough to appeal to underbanked demographics. It uses big data to target âappropriateâ products and services for different customers and reduce risks to the bank. WeBank leverages the gigantic customer base and data from the Tencent ecosystem. WeBank offers preapproved loans to qualifying users of QQ and WeChat, based on proprietary credit scores generated from Tencent data. The bankâs algorithm draws a customer portrait by analyzing many kinds of customer behaviorsâwhat and how much a user buys, what games they play, whom they interact with on QQ and WeChat, and moreâup to 200 different variables per customer. As a result, its non-performing loan (NPL) ratio was just 1.2 percent in 2021, significantly lower than the average NPL level for unsecured retail loans. This platform-centric approach to banking enables WeBank to offer various types of loans to prospective customers from the Tencent ecosystem, supported by its partner bank network. WeBank evaluates loan risk via its advanced risk model and then sells the vetted loans to partner banks that participate in its platform for a small fee. For investing, customers can also purchase mutual funds, money market funds, or other investment products offered by various financial institutions via WeBankâs marketplace. To further enhance the efficiency of the giant platform, WeBank is committed to investing more than 10 percent of its annual revenue in top-notch IT infrastructure every year. These investments have already paid off massively: WeBankâs IT cost is now only one-tenth that of other leading banks in China to achieve the same level of transaction capability. As a result, WeBankâs growth is remarkable: a 36 percent rise in revenue and 39 percent jump in profit in 2021.

Complex financing

Complex financing is the arena for individual and business services that require more sophistication than everyday banking. Examples include mortgages, home equity loans, car loans, and start-up loans. Such services are complex because many kinds of players are part of each ecosystem.

While familiar, these products and services are used less frequently than others, but they have a big impact on the customer. For instance, getting a mortgage is just one aspect of buying a home, which requires navigating a maze of real-estate brokers, lenders, insurers, attorneys, and other professionals. Consumers crave a trusted expert to help them get through that maze and simplify it, weaving it into a single touchpoint.

The end goal for complex financing is journey integrationâmaking these processes convenient, efficient, fast, and low cost yet also as personalized as possible from start to finish via business models such as the following:

Real-estate-journey orchestrator. Serving as an orchestrator of the real-estate journey means handling the complex process of buying, renting, operating, and selling real estate for both individuals and companies and coordinating across mortgages, insurance, utilities, and maintenance with seamless integration. The orchestrator can compete to become the end-to-end âconcierge,â integrating mortgages or rents and all other services into a subscription model.

Equipment and vehicle marketplace specialist. Specializing in the equipment and vehicle marketplace means providing complex financing of cars, trucks, and industrial equipment for individuals and businesses. It can create marketplaces for these high-price goods and support a customerâs journey from selection to financing, insurance, maintenance, and resale.

Mass wholesale intermediation

Mass wholesale intermediation is the corporate-focused arena. Itâs a combination of expertise and new, efficient systems. It includes corporate finance, cash management, portfolio management, M&A advisory, equity and debt financing, and other traditional investment banking offerings. The ultimate goal for mass wholesale intermediation is extreme efficiencyâand know-howâwhich banks can pursue through business models such as the following:

Automated trading and funding marketplace. Serving as an automated marketplace means offering mass wholesale products and services for corporate customers. This model automates large marketplaces of liquid capital via superefficient, frictionless, low-cost platforms, including âtokenizationâ through smart contracts.

Integrated enterprise services platform. Serving as an integrated platform means offering corporate customers deep integration with enterprise systems such as SAP. The platform can personalize and coordinate services such as accounting, commodity trading, and enterprise resource planning.

Banking as a service

BaaS is the only arena thatâs not customer facing. BaaS providers create highly efficient tech and infrastructure platforms, which they can license to customer-facing organizations. Some will offer credit to nonfinancial institutions, enabling them to act as banks; and some will bolster the balance sheets of existing financial institutions. The goal for BaaS is utilityâgiving clients robust, secure, and efficient services and liquidity through business models such as the following:

BaaS utility provider. Providing BaaS utilities is the same kind of relationship that an anonymous food company has with companies such as Costco or Target, creating white-label products for retailers to market under their own brands. BaaS can provide regulatory know-how and back-office services, such as customer service, documentation, and HR.

BaaS balance sheet provider. Providing BaaS balance sheets gives both banks and nonbanks access to distinct pools of capital and offers asset liability management and regulatory-required licensing for nonbanks. By bolstering the balance sheets of banksâ customers, this kind of BaaS greatly reduces their need to keep raising capital.

An inside look at the biggest arena: Everyday banking

The new arenas will require banks or nonbanks to ramp up their presence on new platforms, create touchpoints with customers, and mine and capture data in new ways. To understand how these concepts will play out, letâs examine the biggest arena: everyday banking.

Imagine that a forward-looking bank or a new fintech competitor offers an app we will call âMyLifeAssistant.â MyLifeAssistant will take many existing technologies that customers find on their phonesâand many still to be developedâand fold them into a single offering that addresses a whole range of usersâ daily needs. For instance, it might send an alert that today is the birthday of a friend, along with a gift recommendation. Users could order the gift through MyLifeAssistant and arrange for same-day shipping, or they could shop for alternatives.

Later in the day, when a user visits a local cafÃ©, MyLifeAssistant might preselect their favorite coffee or lunch, giving them one-tap access to their favorite repastâwith discounts and rewards. In fact, MyLifeAssistant is so easy to use that customers use it for investing, planning, shopping, socializing, and more throughout the day. As a customer keeps using MyLifeAssistant for more kinds of shopping and services, the app increasingly knows their friends, how their money is spent, and what they do in their free time. It will also follow them into the metaverse or virtual reality.

Of course, MyLifeAssistant is far more than just a simple app. In fact, MyLifeAssistant is the front-end evidence that the institution that created the app has decided to compete aggressively as a CMS. Behind the scenes, while coordinating all this activity, MyLifeAssistant is constantly adding to its database so that it can improve its future predictions via advanced analytical models.

The more appealing the appâs personalized recommendations become, the more money its users will save via discounts and loyalty programsâand the more commissions the bank will earn from its vendor partners. Everyone involved benefits from MyLifeAssistantâs constantly improving analytics and its ability to automate customer experiences. The more invisible and embedded its services become, the happier its customers.

There are limits. MyLifeAssistant and its parent have strong incentives not to take advantage of their customers. The more partnerships and personalized services that they offer to both individuals and businesses, the more that everyone involved benefits. The key to the parent institutionâs competitiveness and profitability is constantly upgrading its data analytics to improve convenience, customer care, and hypertargeted offeringsâwithout attempting to overcharge or exploit its customers.

By processing both e-commerce and consumer finance transactions (including peer-to-peer payments, car loans, credit cards, and so on), a CMS can begin to predict what customers want even before those desires become conscious. Banks can also sharply reduce their own risks because they will know each customerâs creditworthiness better than most credit rating agencies do.

Again, MyLifeAssistant isnât a banking app. Itâs a core component of being a CMS. It goes far beyond everyday banking services to offer tight integration with e-commerce journeys. It can serve as the hub of an ecosystem that blends banking with shopping and other highly personalized services.

A thriving CMS will offer more than mere personalization, simplicity, and affordability. It will go all the way to invisibility. CMSs will have more access to their customers and much more data about those customers than traditional banks have ever had. Because they will become primary touchpoints for a wide range of transactions, they can build an unbeatable edge in collecting and analyzing big data.

Because commerce market specialists will become primary touchpoints for a wide range of transactions, they can build an unbeatable edge in collecting and analyzing big data.

Excelling at this transition will require banks to look beyond their traditional metrics of success, such as margins and risk costs. They will need to focus more on performance indicators used by leading e-commerce players, such as the number of customer touchpoints and time of engagement. This business model has enormous economic upside. Any bank that successfully transitions into a CMS can multiply revenues by ten, with higher profit margins for higher-value services.

The impact of data and money regulation around the world is uncertain

The kind of transformations and competition that we have examined in everyday banking are sure to take place in each of the other four arenas. But predicting the winners, as well as how long it will take them to get there, in different countries is extremely difficult. Thatâs because itâs hard to say how digital currencies and data will be regulated in the future, especially in a world where countries and regions have such differing approaches to regulation.

Itâs possible that, over the next decade, customer data will become the new oilâhighly regulated, jealously guarded by institutions that capture it, and a key source of business value. A more likely scenario is that customer data will become the new waterâa public utility accessible to all and therefore much lower in value.

And while the advance of digital currencies is unstoppable, its regulatory future is similarly unclear. A decade from now, cryptocurrencies, easily exchanged via blockchain and other tech, might be well established as mainstream alternatives to central-bank currencies. Digital currencies might then be far more convenient for all kinds of transactions and deposits, potentially removing a main function and competitive advantage of banks. On the other hand, there might well be a regulatory backlash against cryptocurrencies, with developed nations cracking down on its misuse for illegal activities or financial warfare.

The landscape of currency could fall anywhere on a spectrum between wide open and tightly closed. However, none of the scenarios would stop whatâs certain to be the breakup of traditional banking. Rather, they would likely determine the shape of the industry and the winning players. If digital currencies become commonplace, banks face a tougher road. If currency isnât a factor, data take center stage and create a more even playing field.

Making things even more uncertain is the fact that banking is a âmultilocalâ rather than a truly global business. Banking experience and regulation differ greatly by region. The average American still uses checks and spends weeks getting a mortgage. The average Dutch citizen pays every bill from a smartphone, opens new bank accounts online, and gets approved for a mortgage in a few days. Regional rules shape what banks can and canât do.

The next phase of banking for incumbents, challengers, and the rest of us

The successful bank of the future will be defined as a network of platforms. Few banks will capture all of the ten platform opportunities described in this article in their regions, but many will participate in multiple platforms. Given the platformsâ enormous value creation scale, getting even one right can unlock tremendous value for shareholders and broader stakeholders alike. But success will come to only those banks willing to move beyond their traditional operating models. Banks should be prepared to evolve through multiple stages on their way to becoming a platform network.

This vision of the coming shakeout may seem daunting. But the challenges are manageable taken one step at a time. The first and most important step is to commit to adapting as soon as possible. Banks and nonbanks that begin to transform themselves now will have a huge advantage over competitors that become paralyzed with indecision and confusion.

The good news is that thereâs still enough time for most financial institutions to transform their business models. Additionally, the capital markets are likely to be very supportive in valuing those transformations over the next five to ten years.

For incumbent, universal banks, the key steps will look something like the following:

Decide which arenas and business models to focus on, based on your strengths. Start to align your organizational resourcesâespecially tech talentâfor the coming shifts. Start to develop and test your platform business models. Redefine your purpose (including your environmental, social, and governance impact) to build stronger bonds with your customers and talent. Build a more entrepreneurial culture by protecting your experimental projects from conservative pressures within the organizationâand give management incentive to succeed.

For challengers looking to exploit a tech edge as a way of entering banking, the first step is to analyze which arenas offer maximum advantage based on that edge and which platform-based business model makes most sense. These organizations will have the advantage of not being tied to the old standards and practices of traditional financial services. But they need to be mindful that this advantage doesnât guarantee success, even for companies with cutting-edge innovations.

To be clear, this transformation will take time, but leaders who move fast, stay ahead of the curve, and remain patient can break out of todayâs stagnant growth trajectory and put themselves on a strong valuation path. Many banks already are moving forward and getting recognition from the market. We believe that as more and more banks embrace this kind of transformation, the market will see the change, recognize the increasing potential, and view the industry as one with a bright future.

Ultimately, whether you are the leader of a company that depends on banking or a consumer hoping to enjoy better customer service in your life, there is a lot to look forward to. The new era of banking will arrive after a period of complex, confusing evolution, but it will ultimately raise the quality of life for anyone who interacts with any kind of financial services, including customers, employees, shareholders, and regulatorsâwhich, of course, is everyone."

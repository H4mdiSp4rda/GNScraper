# Script Usage:
To manage data in MongoDB using the provided script, you can use the following command-line arguments:

- `--scrap`: Use this argument to initiate data scraping. Specify the desired language for scraping by providing one of the supported language codes (e.g., "EN" for English, "FR" for French, "ES" for Spanish). You must also specify the insertion method as "auto" or "manual" to decide whether to store the scraped data in the database automatically or prompt for confirmation. Example usage:
  `python script.py --scrap EN auto`
- `--query`: Use this argument to query the MongoDB collection and retrieve stored data.
- `--purge`: Clear (purge) the MongoDB collection and remove all data by using this argument.
- `--classify`: Classify the news articles in MongoDB and add a label (Real news/Fake news) to each one.
